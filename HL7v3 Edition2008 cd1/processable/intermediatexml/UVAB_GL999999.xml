Secondarily, the billing account may contribute significant information to cost accounting and financial decision support systems.  A billing account is simply that entity that captures the elements reflecting the cost and price of services provided and supplies consumed for a healthcare activity.  The focus for which an account accumulates information will vary.  (For example: In a realm where billing is based on periodically collecting financial transactions for a patient, the accumulator might be the patient.)  A billing account might also include links to insurance and benefit information, and relevant responsible parties.</p></def></gitem></glist></div2></div1></body></spec>
