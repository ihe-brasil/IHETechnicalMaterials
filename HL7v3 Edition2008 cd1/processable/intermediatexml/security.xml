				<head>Conformance</head>
				<p>Interoperability is dependent upon organizations building roles from normative objects and actions defined within this vocabulary and nothing more.  The vocabulary makes no assumptions regarding any negotiated trust that exists between communicating partners or the protocols used to exchange role information.  In terms of the normative vocabulary it is sufficient and complete that interoperating agencies convey which permissions have been granted to an entity.  There is no presumption of which workflow or process that the user is engaged in or what accesses the entity may be granted by a business partner.  The authorization assertion only conveys the rights that the owing organization has bestowed.  Business partner relationships or policy exchanges may be needed to clarify how trusting organizations will treat a specific permission assertion.</p>
				<p>To conform to ANSI INCITS<footnote><p>ANSI – INCITS (American National Standards Institute &mdash; International Committee for Information Technology Standards)</p></footnote> role-based access control standards, a role definition consists of a name and a corresponding set of permissions.  In different policy domains, the selection of permissions establishing a special role might be different.  When used to define ANSI INCITS compliant healthcare roles, the open list of permissions defined by the HL7 permission vocabulary in the healthcare domain is mandatory.  An implementation is said to be conformant when it contains only permissions selected from the HL7 defined permission catalog.  Additions to the HL7 permission catalog are anticipated and allowed using the described process that has become part of the HL7 HDF; however, any implementation which adopts such extensions prior to having those changes approved by HL7 ballot would be considered non-conformant. This is not to say however that only the HL7 vocabulary can be used for RBAC implementation.  The HL7 vocabulary and defined ANSI INCITS healthcare roles should instead be considered a baseline for interoperability between different policy domains but not constricted to them.  Permissions {object, operation} pairs not currently found in this version of the HL7 Permission Catalog should be brought forward to the HL7 RBAC Security Task Force for consideration to add to the HL7 normative vocabulary.</p>
				<p>For example, in the case of orders, the standard vocabulary provides for separation between order creation and signature as distinct permissions.  While some organization implementation may not distinguish between these, locally granting signature rights to holders of the “create order” permission, there should be no expectation that receiving parties would be required to follow suit and accordingly they may “deny” signature rights if such rights are not explicitly asserted.  In fact, the receiving organization may “deny” signature rights even if asserted by the entity’s parent organization.  Such policy matters are not a matter for the vocabulary definition which is neutral to these issues, but resides more with intra/extra organization policy negotiation.  Organizations that require non-standard interpretations of the standard vocabulary also have the option of accommodating implementation concerns by simply mapping the standard vocabulary to their own proprietary systems.  Regardless, interoperability requires use of the appropriate normative permissions if the organization expects the receiving organization to correctly interpret and apply their assertions.</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="confscope">
				<head>Scope</head>
				<p>This vocabulary provides access control information supporting access control decision and enforcement functions as defined by ISO 10181.3.  Other forms of access control information are possible; including entity based access control and context based access control outside the scope of these definitions.  This vocabulary does not presume or prevent organizations from executing these controls or other local constraints used for other purposes (e.g., cardinality constraints regarding the number of persons asserting a role with a specific permission at a particular time).  Specifically, this vocabulary does not prohibit use of logical rules and policies that an entity may choose to execute.  This vocabulary is consistent with OASIS XACML and ANSI INCITS RBAC standards allowing entities to integrate RBAC into their total access management solution.  This vocabulary is appropriate for RBAC only and may not be appropriate for use by other security services.  There is nothing in these definitions to suggest that RBAC completely defines all aspects of access control information, only that which is necessary for interoperability defined by roles.</p>
				<p>The Security TC plans to consider situations including domains that reflect specific types of policies in the future suitable for use in one domain and not another.  Domain considerations are out of scope of the current permission definitions.</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="Extensibility">
				<head>Extensibility</head>
				<p>This vocabulary includes a non-normative “Role Engineering Process” which has been added to the HL7 Health Data Repository (HL7 HDR<footnote><p>HDR – Health Data Repository</p></footnote>).  This process may be used by organizations to create new permissions that are consistent with the HL7 permission definitions.  Such permissions may be submitted to the HL7 Security Technical Committee along with associated scenarios and artifacts for proposed extensions to the normative vocabulary or simply adopted as proprietary non-interoperable or local domain extensions.</p>

							<td>Patient Allergy or Adverse Reaction</td>

It includes adverse events occurring from drug overdose, whether accidental or intentional, drug abuse, drug withdrawal, and significant failure of expected pharmacological action.  A proven cause-and-effect relationship between the reaction and suspected drug(s) is not required before a reaction is reportable; reasonable suspicion is sufficient.  Blood products are specifically excluded from adverse drug event monitoring and should be reported utilizing reporting mechanisms specifically designed for these products.  An allergy is an adverse reaction mediated by an immunologic mechanism.</td>
