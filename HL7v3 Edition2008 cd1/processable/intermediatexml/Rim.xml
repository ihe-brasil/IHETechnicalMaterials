			<head>Introduction</head>
			<div2 id="rimBkg">
				<head>Background</head>
				<p>The Health Level Seven (HL7) Reference Information Model (RIM) is a static model of health and health care information as viewed within the scope of HL7 standards development activities.  It is the combined consensus view of information from the perspective of the HL7 working group and the HL7 international affiliates.  The RIM is the ultimate source from which all HL7 version 3.0 protocol specification standards draw their information-related content.</p>
				<div3 id="rimBkgHist">
					<head>History of the RIM</head>
					<p>Development of the HL7 RIM began in April 1996. The first release of the RIM was adopted by the HL7 Technical Steering Committee at the January 1997 working group meeting. This release was known as the HL7 draft RIM version 0.80.</p>
					<p>The next two working group meetings focused on gaining familiarity with the draft RIM and implementing a process for obtaining and reconciling proposed enhancements to the model. The RIM maintenance process became known as "RIM harmonization."  Between 1998 and 2000, there were nine harmonization meetings to consider proposed enhancements to the draft RIM. The meetings culminated in version 1.0 of the HL7 RIM, unveiled at the HL7 working group meeting held in January 2001. The harmonization meetings focused on five major themes:</p>
					<list role="unordered">
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Ensure coverage of HL7 version 2.x.</emph> This set of change proposals introduced content to the draft model to ensure that it included all the information content of HL7 version 2.x.</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Remove unsubstantiated content from the model.</emph> This set of change proposals focused on removing content from the draft model that the steward technical committee did not originate and could find no rationale for retaining.</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Unified service action model.</emph> This set of change proposals introduced a concise, well-defined set of structures and vocabularies that address the information needs of a wide variety of clinical scenarios. This collection of proposals, know as USAM, involved the combined effort of multiple technical committees.</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Ensure quality.</emph> This set of change proposals addressed inconsistencies in the draft model and conflicts between the model and the modeling style guide. It began the practice of recording and tracking open issues in the model.</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Address the "left hand side" of the model.</emph> This set of change proposals introduced powerful structures and vocabularies for the non-clinical portions of the model (patient administration, finance, scheduling). Like the unified service action model, this proposal involved the combined effort of multiple technical committees.</item>
					</list>
					<p>The harmonization process and themes have produced an HL7 reference information model that is credible, clear, comprehensive, concise, and consistent. Its structure is both flexible and extensible, and its contents can be readily mapped to the HL7 2.x message standard and other widely used healthcare dataset specifications.</p>
					<p>This ballot is release 1.22 of the HL7 RIM.  It is a model that continues to be fine tuned as technical committees use it for an ever widening scope of work as part of developing a family of HL7 model-driven standards, HL7 version 3.0.  The RIM is now remarkably stable and at the same time the harmonization process ensures it will always be relevant and reflective of the information needs of the HL7 standards.
</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="rimBkgH7use">
					<head>Use of the RIM by HL7</head>
					<p>The HL7 RIM is a critical component of the V3 development process.  It is the root of all information models and structures developed as part of the V3 development process.</p>
					<p>The HL7 V3 standard development process is a model-driven methodology in which a network of inter-related models are developed that depict the static and behavioral aspects of the requirements and design of HL7 standards, as well as the underlying semantics and business rules that govern them.</p>
					<p>The RIM provides a static view of the information needs of HL7 V3 standards.  It includes class and state-machine diagrams and is accompanied by use case models, interaction models, data type models, terminology models, and other types of models to provide a complete view of the requirements and design of HL7 standards.  The classes, attributes, state-machines, and relationships in the RIM are used to derive domain-specific information models that are then transformed through a series of constraining refinement processes to eventually yield a static model of the information content of an HL7 standard.</p>
					<p>The HL7 V3 standard development process defines the rules governing the derivation of domain information models from the RIM and the refinement of those models into HL7 standard specifications.  The rules require that all information structures in derived models be traceable back to the RIM and that their semantic and related business rules not conflict with those specified in the RIM.  The RIM therefore is the ultimate source for all information content in HL7 V3 standards.</p>
					<p>The RIM is used by HL7 international affiliates to extend HL7 V3 standards to meet local needs.  Through a process known as localization, V3 standard specifications are extended using the RIM as the source for new information content.  This new information is derived from the RIM and refined in the same manner used to create the original specification.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="eimBkgOutUse">
					<head>Uses of the RIM Outside of HL7</head>
					<p>The RIM is primarily for use by HL7 and its international affiliates.  However, others outside of HL7 have also found the RIM useful.  Early adopters of the V3 standards development process have used the RIM to develop HL7-like message specifications in their own environments.  These early adopters include vendors, large integrated delivery networks, and government agencies within the United States and internationally.  These same early adopters are extremely active in HL7 and provide practical input to the RIM and other aspects of V3 the development process.</p>
					<p>Some HL7 member organizations have reported using the RIM as a source of input to their enterprise information architectures or as a starting place for systems analysis and design.  The RIM may indeed be useful for such purposes; however, HL7 provides no assurance that the RIM is useful for anything other than as a reference model for HL7 standards development.</p>
					<p>The RIM is only one model of healthcare information needs.  The abstract style of the RIM and the ability to extend the RIM through vocabulary specifications make the RIM applicable to any conceivable healthcare system information interchange scenario.  In fact, it is conceptually applicable to any information domain involving entities playing roles and participating in acts.</p>
					<p>The universal applicability of the RIM makes it particularly useful for an organization like HL7 that has to consider the needs of a large and diverse membership.  The style of the RIM makes it extremely stable, which is another important characteristic for HL7.  The HL7 standards development process calls for the creation of domain specific models derived from the RIM and the incremental refinement of those models into design models that are specific to the problem area.  These problem area specific design models narrow the abstractness of the RIM and include constraints on attribute values and class relationships that are use case specific.  External organizations considering using the HL7 RIM are advised to adopt a similar process of deriving design models as a transformation of the RIM.</p>
				</div3>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="rimBallImplic">
				<head>Implications of Balloting the RIM</head>
				<p>Balloting the RIM establishes it as more than just an internal HL7 artifact.  As a balloted standard the RIM will be advanced as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard and perhaps as an ISO standard.  Other ANSI or ISO accredited standards organizations such as X12 and CEN-TC251 (European Standardization of Health Informatics) have expressed interest in using or referencing the RIM in their own standards development work.  Establishing the RIM as a standard makes its use by other standards development organizations (SDO) much easier.  The potential for tremendous benefits exists by having a common reference information model used across multiple healthcare SDOs.</p>
				<p>A balloted RIM is also important to meet the local standards needs of HL7 International Affiliates.  In order for the affiliates to apply localized extensions to HL7 standards according to the HL7 V3 standard development process, the RIM itself must be a standard.  This is often mandated by local geopolitical jurisdictions, e.g., to ensure that local standards are extensions of already approved general standards.</p>
				<p>Federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States are encouraged to consider accredited national standards when conducting initiatives in which the standards are applicable.  As a standard for information content of HL7 interoperability standards, U.S. governmental agencies will need to consider the applicability of the RIM when establishing health care systems interoperability solutions.</p>
				<div3 id="rimImpNorm">
					<head>Normative Portions of the RIM</head>
					<p>The RIM consists of classes assigned to one or more subject area packages.  Attributes, Relationships, and State Machines are associated with classes.  Only the classes included in the NormativeContent subject area and their associated attributes, relationships, and state machines are normative.  Relationships between normative and non-normative classes are non-normative.</p>
					<p>The RIM is expressed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) with HL7 specific tags as extensions to the UML model element metadata.  All standard UML model element metadata values are normative but only the following HL7 extensions are also normative:</p>
					<list role="unordered">
						<item>Class.stateAttribute</item>
						<item>Class.classCode</item>
						<item>Attribute.mandatoryInclusion</item>
						<item>Attribute.cardinality</item>
						<item>Attribute.vocabDomain</item>
						<item>Attribute.vocabStrength</item>
					</list>
					<p>The remaining HL7 extensions are for administrative use only and are not part of the normative RIM specification.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="rimImpNormRef">
					<head>Normative References</head>
					<p>The V3 Data type specifications (<xspecref spec="datatypes.htm" alt="Data Types Abstract Specification"/> and <xspecref spec="datatypes-its-xml.htm" alt="V3 Data Types Implementable Technology Specification for XML"/>) are related normative standards that are balloted independent of the RIM. The <xspecref spec="vocabulary.htm" alt="HL7 Vocabulary Domain"/> specification is an informative reference that includes a variety of tables and terminology references that are cited as domains by various RIM attributes.  The vocabulary specifications for what are termed "structural attributes" are part of the normative RIM ballot because they are fundamental to the proper representation of health information using the RIM. A list of these normative tables and hyperlinks to them are provided <loc href="#sbj-rimdiv">at the end of this introduction</loc>.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="rimImpNormMean">
					<head>Meaning of Normative</head>
					<p>The normative portions of the RIM are the only portions subject to ballot and are the only portions for which conformance rules are defined.  Substantive changes to normative RIM model elements require a re-ballot of the RIM.  When re-balloting the RIM only the substantive changes are subject to ballot.  The following changes to the RIM are not considered substantive:</p>
					<list role="unordered">
						<item>Changes to descriptive text for model elements that does not materially alter the semantics of the model element;</item>
						<item>Changes to class package assignments other than additions or deletions from the NormativeContent subject area;</item>
						<item>Changes in package hierarchies or names;</item>
						<item>Changes to class diagram layouts;</item>
						<item>Changes to model elements outside the NormativeContent subject area package.</item>
					</list>
				</div3>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="rimUnder">
				<head>Understanding the RIM</head>
				<p>The RIM uses a very abstract modeling style.  The back-bone classes of the RIM and their structural attributes are its core.  An understanding of these classes and attributes are essential to understanding the RIM.</p>
				<div3 id="rimUnderAbst">
					<head>RIM as an abstract model</head>
					<p>The RIM is comprised of six "back-bone" classes:</p>
					<list role="unordered">
						<item>
							<loc href="#Act-cls">Act</loc> which  represents the actions that are executed and must be documented as health care is managed and provided;</item>
						<item>
							<loc href="#Participation-cls">Participation</loc> which expresses the context for an act in terms such as who performed it, for whom it was done, where it was done, etc.;</item>
						<item>
							<loc href="#Entity-cls">Entity</loc> which represents the physical things and beings that are of interest to, and take part in health care;</item>
						<item>
							<loc href="#Role-cls">Role</loc> which establishes the roles that entities play as they participate in health care acts;</item>
						<item>
							<loc href="#ActRelationship-cls">ActRelationship</loc> which represents the binding of one act to another, such as the relationship between an order for an observation and the observation event as it occurs; and</item>
						<item>
							<loc href="#RoleLink-cls">RoleLink</loc> which represents relationships between individual roles.</item>
					</list>
					<p>Three of these classes -- Act, Entity and Role -- are further represented by a set of specialized classes, or sub-types. In the HL7 representation, a sub-type is only added to the RIM if it requires one or more attributes or associations that are not inherited from its parents. Classes that represent distinct concepts, but which need no further attributes or associations are represented solely as a unique code in the controlling vocabulary. Therefore, these three classes include the following coded attributes, which serve to further define the concept being modeled:</p>
					<list role="unordered">
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">classCode </emph>(in Act, Entity and Role) represents the exact class or concept intended, whether or not that class is represented as a class in the RIM hierarchy;</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">moodCode </emph>(in Act) and <emph role="strong">determinerCode </emph>(in Entity) an attribute that distinguishes whether the class represents an instance or a kind of Act or Entity. If the class is a specialization of Act then moodCode further delineates the instance as an occurrence or an intent;</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">code </emph>(in Act, Entity and Role) provides for further classification within a particular classCode value, such as a particular type of observation within the Observation class.
</item>
					</list>
					<p>The other three RIM back-bone classes -- Participation, ActRelationship and RoleLink -- are not represented by generalization-specialization hierarchies. Nevertheless, these classes represent a variety of concepts, such as different forms of participation or different kinds of relationships between acts. These distinctions are represented by a <emph role="strong">typeCode </emph>attribute that is asserted for each of these classes.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="rimUnderClsRep">
					<head>Representation of RIM class structure</head>
					<p>As noted previously, the RIM is modeled using a subset of the semantics embodied in UML. The RIM is a set of UML classes, each containing one or more attributes, which are assigned a data type based on an independent specification of Version 3 data types. The classes are linked either by a set of association relationships, identified by unique role names, or by generalization relationships.</p>
					<p>Each of these elements includes a textual definition. The appearance of attributes and associations is controlled by cardinality and related constraints applied to the attributes and to the roles that link the associations to the classes.
</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="rimUnderVocRep">
					<head>Representation of controlling vocabulary</head>
					<p>Several of the attributes in the RIM are coded with the CS data type, which means that the value set to be used for those attributes must be drawn from the set of codes that have been defined by HL7. The classCode and typeCode attributes mentioned above are examples of attributes with a CS data type.</p>
					<p>All of the code sets for these attributes are included as part of this ballot and are subject to the same voting principles as the classes in the RIM. Each code set is represented as a vocabulary domain -- the set of all concepts that can be taken as valid values in an instance of a coded field or attribute. It is important to note that a vocabulary domain consists of a set of concepts, not a set of words or codes.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="rimUnderRelated">
					<head>Related specifications</head>
					<p>As noted above, each attribute in the RIM is assigned a data type. The formal specification for these data types is embodied in the normative specification  "<xspecref spec="datatypes-its-xml.htm" alt="HL7 V3 Data Types Implementable Technology Specification for XML"/>" and the informative document "<xspecref spec="datatypes.htm" alt="Data Types Abstract Specification"/>", both of which are currently being balloted by HL7. A table that abstracts the definition of the data types used in the RIM is included in this ballot as Appendix B.</p>

			<div2 id="rimSpec">
				<head>The RIM specification and diagrams</head>
				<div3 id="rimSpecClsSa">
					<head>RIM Subject Areas and Classes</head>
					<p>The specification of the subject areas and classes of the RIM are the content of the following sections of this document.  Individual subject areas and classes are "tagged" with an icon that indicates which elements are normative, and which are reference material.  (<xspecref spec="backbone.htm" ref="bbballokey" alt="Interpretations of these icons"/> can be found in the backbone documents.)</p>

These are the tables for the structural attributes (those with data type of "CS") in the normative classes.  A hyper-link to each of these tables is provided in the RIM specification at the point where the table is cited.  In addition, direct linkage to these tables is provided below:</p>

					<p>A record of something that is being done, has been done, can be done, or is intended or requested to be done.</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Examples:</emph> The kinds of acts that are common in health care are (1) a clinical observation, (2) an assessment of health condition (such as problems and diagnoses), (3) healthcare goals, (4) treatment services (such as medication, surgery, physical and psychological therapy), (5) assisting, monitoring or attending, (6) training and education services to patients and their next of kin, (7) and notary services (such as advanced directives or living will), (8)  editing and maintaining documents, and many others.</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Discussion and Rationale:</emph> Acts are the pivot of the RIM; all domain information and processes are represented primarily in Acts. Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.</p>
					<p>Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.</p>
					<p>One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who "owns" the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.</p>
					<p>In this sense, an Act-instance represents a "statement" according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.]  Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but "a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done." Rector and Nowlan go on saying that "the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view." Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.</p>
					<p>Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as "speech-acts" in linguistics and philosophy.  The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].</p>
					<p>An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance's life cycle.  This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category "sequel").</p>
					<p>Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent "objective state of affairs" or "real processes" independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.</p>

						<dtRef ref="CS"/>
						<p>A code specifying the major type of Act that this Act-instance represents.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> The classCode domain is a tightly controlled vocabulary, not an external or user-defined vocabulary. </p>
						<p>Every Act-instance must have a classCode. If the act class is not further specified, the most general Act.classCode (ACT) is used.</p>
						<p>The Act.classCode must be a generalization of the specific Act concept (e.g., as expressed in Act.code), in other words, the Act concepts conveyed in an Act must be specializations of the Act.classCode. Especially, the classCode is not a "modifier" or the Act.code that can alter the meaning of a class code. (See Act.code for contrast.)</p>
					</attr>
					<attr id="Act-moodCode-att" name="moodCode" type="CS" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="1..1" Mandatory="M" DomainSpec="ActMood" CodingStrength="CNE">
						<dtRef ref="CS"/>
						<p>A code distinguishing whether an Act is conceived of as a factual statement or in some other manner as a command, possibility, goal, etc.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> An Act-instance must have one and only one moodCode value.</p>
						<p>The moodCode of a single Act-instance never changes. Mood is not state.</p>
						<p>To describe the progression of a business activity from defined to planned to executed, etc. one must instantiate different Act-instances in the different moods and link them using ActRelationship of general type "sequel". (See ActRelationship.typeCode.)</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> The Act.moodCode includes the following notions: (1) event, i.e., factual description of an actions that occurred; (2) definition of possible actions and action plans (the master file layer); (3) intent, i.e., an action plan instantiated for a patient as a care plan or order; (4) goal, i.e., an desired outcome attached to patient problems and plans; and (5) criterion, i.e., a predicate used to evaluate a logical expression.</p>
						<p>The Act.moodCode modifies the meaning of the Act class in a controlled way, just as in natural language, grammatical form of a verb modify the meaning of a sentence in defined ways.  For example, if the mood is factual (event), then the entire act object represents a known fact. If the mood expresses a plan (intent), the entire act object represents the expectation of what should be done.  The mood does not change the meaning of individual act properties in peculiar ways.</p>
						<p>Since the mood code is a determining factor for the meaning of an entire Act object, the mood must always be known.  This means, whenever an act object is instantiated, the mood attribute must be assigned to a valid code, and the mood assignment cannot change throughout the lifetime of an act object.</p>
						<p>As the meaning of an act object is factored in the mood code, the mood code affects the interpretation of the entire Act object and with it every property (attributes and associations).  Note that the mood code affects the interpretation of the act object, and the meaning of the act object in turn determines the meaning of the attributes.  However, the mood code does not arbitrarily change the meaning of individual attributes.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Inert vs. descriptive properties of Acts:</emph> Acts have two kinds of act properties, inert and descriptive properties.  Inert properties are not affected by the mood, descriptive properties follow the mood of the object.  For example, there is an identifier attribute Act.id, which gives a unique identification to an act object.  Being a unique identifier for the object is in no way dependent on the mood of the act object.  Therefore, the "interpretation" of the Act.id attribute is inert with respect to the act object's mood.</p>
						<p>By contrast, most of the Act class' attributes are descriptive for what the Act statement expresses.  Descriptive properties of the Act class give answer to the questions who, whom, where, with what, how and when the action is done.  The questions who, whom, with what, and where are answered by Participations, while how and when are answered by descriptive attributes and ActRelationships.  The interpretation of a descriptive attribute is aligned to the interpretation of the entire act object, and controlled by the mood. </p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> To illustrate the effect of mood code, consider a "blood glucose" observation:</p>
						<p>The DEFINITION mood specifies the Act of "obtaining blood glucose". Participations describe in general the characteristics of the people who must be involved in the act, and the required objects, e.g., specimen, facility, equipment, etc. involved. The Observation.value specifies the absolute domain (range) of the observation (e.g., 15-500 mg/dl).</p>
						<p>In INTENT mood the author of the intent expresses the intent that he or someone else "should obtain blood glucose". The participations are the people actually or supposedly involved in the intended act, especially the author of the intent or any individual assignments for group intents, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.). The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the intent is to measure blood glucose, not to measure blood glucose in a specific range. (But compare with GOAL below).</p>
						<p>In REQUEST mood, a kind of intent, the author requests to "please obtain blood glucose". The Participations are the people actually and supposedly involved in the act, especially the placer and the designated filler, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.). The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the order is not to measure blood glucose in a specific range.</p>
						<p>In EVENT mood, the author states that "blood glucose was obtained". Participations are the people actually involved in the act, and the objects actually involved (e.g., specimen, facilities, equipment). The Observation.value is the value actually obtained (e.g., 80 mg/dL, or &lt;15 mg/dL).</p>
						<p>In event-CRITERION mood, an author considers a certain class of "obtaining blood glucose" possibly with a certain value (range) as outcome. The Participations constrain the criterion, for instance, to a particular patient. The Observation.value is the range in which the criterion would hold (e.g. &gt; 180 mg/dL or 200-300 mg/dL).</p>
						<p>In GOAL mood (a kind of criterion), the author states that "our goal is to be able to obtain blood glucose with the given value (range)". The Participations are similar to intents, especially the author of the goal and the patient for whom the goal is made. The Observation.value is the range which defined when the goal is met (e.g.  80-120 mg/dl).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Rationale:</emph> The notion of "mood" is borrowed from natural language grammar, the mood of a verb (lat. modus verbi).  </p>
						<p>The notion of mood also resembles the various extensions of the logic of facts in modal logic and logic with modalities, where the moodCode specifies the modality (fact, possibility, intention, goal, etc.) under which the Act-statement is judged as appropriate or defective.</p>
					</attr>
					<attr id="Act-id-att" name="id" type="SET&lt;II&gt;" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..*">
						<dtRef ref="SET_II"/>
						<p>A unique identifier for the Act.</p>
					</attr>
					<attr id="Act-code-att" name="code" type="CD" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1" DomainSpec="ActCode" CodingStrength="CWE">
						<dtRef ref="CD"/>
						<p>A code specifying the particular kind of Act that the Act-instance represents within its class.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems.  The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.</p>
						<p>Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.</p>
						<p>Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code "potassium" together with and Act.classCode for "laboratory observation" to somehow mean "potassium laboratory observation" and then use the same Act.code for "potassium" together with Act.classCode for "medication" to mean "substitution of potassium". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> Act.code is not a required attribute of Act. Rather than naming the kind of Act using an Act.code, one can specify the Act using only the class code and other attributes and properties of the Act. In general and more commonly, the kind of Act is readily specified by an ActRelationship specifying that this Act instantiates another Act in definition mood.  Or, even without reference to an act definition, the act may be readily described by other attributes, ActRelationships and Participations. For example, the kind of SubstanceAdministration may be readily described by referring to the specific drug, as the Participation of an Entity representing that drug.</p>
					</attr>
					<attr id="Act-negationInd-att" name="negationInd" type="BL" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="BL"/>
						<p>An indicator specifying that the Act statement is a negation of the Act as described by the descriptive attributes.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> Used with an Observation event, it allows one to say "patient has NO chest pain". With an Observation criterion it negates the criterion analogously, e.g., "if patient has NO chest pain for 3 days ...", or "if systolic blood pressure is <emph role="strong">not</emph> within 90-100 mm Hg ..."</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> The negationInd works as a negative existence quantifier. This is best explained on Acts in criterion mood, and then translates into all other moods. In criterion mood without negation, one usually only specifies a few critical attributes and relationships (features) of an Act, i.e., only those that are needed to test the criterion. The more features one specifies, the more constrained (specific) is the criterion.  For example, to test for "systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg", one would use only the descriptive attributes Act.code (for systolic blood pressure) and Observation.value (for 90-100 mm Hg). If one would also specify an effectiveTime, i.e., for "yesterday", the criterion would be more constrained. If the negationInd is true for the above criterion, then the meaning of the test is whether a systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg yesterday does <emph role="strong">not exist</emph> (independent of whether any blood pressure was measured).</p>
						<p>The negationInd negates the Act as described by the descriptive properties (including Act.code, Act.effectiveTime, Observation.value, Act.doseQty, etc.) and any of its components. The inert properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, Act.confidentialityCode, and particularly the Author-Participation are <emph role="strong">not</emph> negated. These inert properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains to be the author of the negative observation. Also, most ActRelationships (except for components) are not included in the negation. </p>
						<p>For example, a highly confidential order written by Dr. Jones, to explicitly <emph role="strong">not</emph> give "succinyl choline" for the "reason" (ActRelationship) of a history of malignant hyperthermia (Observation) negates the descriptive properties "give succinyl choline" (Act.code), but it is still positively an order and written by Dr. Jones and for patient John Smith, and the reason for this order is the patient's history of malignant hyperthermia. </p>
						<p>However, additional detail in descriptive attributes will be part of the negation which then limits the effectiveness of the negated statement. For example, had the order not to give a substance included a doseQuantity, it would mean that the substance should not be given at that particular dose (but any other dose might still be O.K.).</p>
						<p>An act statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated "finding of wheezing on July 1" means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation. Conversely, negation indicator does <emph role="strong">not</emph> just negate that the fact was affirmed or that the statement had been made. This holds for all moods in the same way, e.g., a negated order is an order <emph role="strong">not</emph> to do the described act, not just the lapidary statement that there is no such order.</p>

					<attr id="Act-derivationExpr-att" name="derivationExpr" type="ST" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="ST"/>
						<p>A character string containing a formal language expression that specifies how the Act's attributes are (should be or have been) derived from input parameters associated with derivation relationships.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> Derived observations can be defined through association with other observations using ActRelationships of type "derivation". For example, to define a derived observation for Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) one will associate the MCH observation with a Hemoglobin (HGB) observation and a Red Blood cell Count (RBC) observation. And the derivation expression encodes the formula: MCH = HGB / RBC.</p>
						<p>The derivation expression is represented as a character string.</p>
						<p>[Note: The syntax of that expression is yet to be fully specified. There would be a single standard expression language rather than an optional choice between many expression languages. The syntax would be based on a de-facto standard for many object-oriented languages, such as C++, Java, OCL etc. A concrete specification of this expression language is being worked on now and drafts can be expected within the year 2003.]</p>

							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This is not a formal identifier but rather a human-recognizable common name.  However it is similar to the id attribute in that it refers to a specific Act rather than a 'kind' of act.  (For definition mood, the title refers to that specific definition, rather than to a broad category that might be conveyed with Act.code.)</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Note:</emph> This attribute was <emph role="strong">not</emph> in the normative content balloted and approved for the first release of HL7's Reference Information Model Standard.  The attribute will be considered when the RIM is prepared for balloting the second release.  The attribute is being used in current HL7 Version 3 designs.</p>

					<attr id="Act-text-att" name="text" type="ED" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="ED"/>
						<p>A renderable textual or multimedia description (or reference to a description) of the complete information which would reasonably be expected to be displayed to a human reader conveyed by the Act.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> For act definitions, the Act.text can contain textbook-like information about that act. For act orders, the description will contain particular instructions pertaining only to that order. </p>
						<p>The content of the description is not considered part of the functional information communicated between computer systems. For Acts that involve human readers and performers, however, computer systems must show the Act.text field to a human user, who has responsibility for the activity; or at least must indicate the existence of the Act.text information and allow the user to see that information.</p>
						<p>Free text descriptions are used to help an individual interpret the content and context of the act, but all information relevant for automated functions must be communicated using the proper attributes and associated objects.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Usage:</emph> The intent is that a user can read Act.text alone without seeing any of the encoded information and have no risk of misinterpreting or lacking full understanding of the full content of the Act. For example, II.root, or CD.codeSystem would not normally be displayed to a human and thus would not need to be exposed as part of Act.text.</p>
						<p>The rendering is expected to include all 'descendant' ActRelationships and Participations recursively navigating child Acts as exposed in that particular 'snapshot'. However, there are several data elements which are NOT expected to be included in the rendering. These are:</p>
						<list role="unordered">
							<item>
								<p>Component Sections (ActRelationship=COMP, classCode &lt;= DOCSECT)</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>the title attribute</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>anything attached to ActRelationship=XFRM)</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>Previous versions (ActRelationship=RPLC)</p>
							</item>
						</list>
						<p>Act.text can include information that is not in the other attributes/associations, but must include all information which is in such attributes or associations (with the exception of those identified above).</p>
						<p>Act.text SHOULD NOT be used for the sharing of computable information. Computable information must be conveyed using discrete attributes. Any information which Act.text contains not elsewhere exposed in encoded information will be opaque to computer systems. For this reason, Act.text should not be used to contain information which negates or significantly modifies the understanding of information encoded in discrete attributes.</p>
						<p>To communicate "supplemental text", an act relationship (e.g. "component" or "subject of") should be created to a separate Act with a bare Act.text attribute should be used to convey the supplemental information, possibly with a code indicating "annotation" or some similar concept.</p>

					<attr id="Act-statusCode-att" name="statusCode" type="CS" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1" DomainSpec="ActStatus" CodingStrength="CNE">
						<dtRef ref="CS"/>
						<p>A code specifying the state of the Act.</p>
						<p>
							<emph role="strong">Guidance: </emph>The status reflects the state of the activity.  In the case of an Observation, this is the status of the activity of observing, not the status of what is being observed (e.g. disease status, "Active" allergy to penicillin).

							<emph role="strong">Design Advisory: </emph>This attribute was defined in the original RIM as repeating, owing to the presence of nested states in the state machines.

					</attr>
					<attr id="Act-effectiveTime-att" name="effectiveTime" type="GTS" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="GTS"/>
						<p>A time expression specifying the focal or operative time of the Act, the primary time for which the Act holds, the time of interest from the perspective of the Act's intention.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> For clinical Observations, the effectiveTime is the time at which the observation holds (is effective) for the patient.</p>
						<p>For contracts, the effectiveTime is the time for which the contract is in effect.</p>
						<p>For consents, the effectiveTime is the time for which the consent is valid.</p>
						<p>For substance administrations, the effective time is the time over which the substance is to be administered, including the frequency of administration (e.g. TID for 10 days)</p>
						<p>For a surgical procedure (operation), the effectiveTime is the time relevant for the patient, i.e., between incision and last suture. </p>
						<p>For transportation acts, the effective time is the time the transported payload is en route.</p>
						<p>For patient encounters, this is the "administrative" time, i.e., the encounter start and end date required to be chosen by business rules, as opposed to the actual time the healthcare encounter related work is performed.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> The effectiveTime is also known as the "primary" time (Arden Syntax) or the "biologically relevant time" (HL7 v2.x). This attribute is distinguished from activityTime.</p>
						<p>For observations, the time of the observation activity may be much later than the time of the observed feature. For instance, in a Blood Gas Analysis (BGA), a result will always come up several minutes after the specimen was taken, meanwhile the patient's physiological state may have changed significantly.  </p>
						<p>For essentially physical activities (surgical procedures, transportations, etc.), the effective time is the time of interest for the Act's intention, i.e., since the intention of a transportation is to deliver a payload from location A to B, the effectiveTime is the time this payload is underway from A to B. However, the Act usually also includes accidental work which is necessary to perform the intention of the Act, but is not relevant for the Act's purpose. </p>
						<p>For example, the time a driver needs to go to the pick-up location A and then return from drop-off location B to some home base, is included in the physical activity, but does not matter from the perspective of the payload's transportation. Another example is: a person's work hours (effectiveTime) may be from 8 AM to 5 PM, no matter whether that person needs 10 minutes for the commute or 2 hours. The commute is necessary to be at work, but it is not essential for the work hours.</p>
					</attr>
					<attr id="Act-activityTime-att" name="activityTime" type="GTS" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="GTS"/>
						<p>A time expression specifying when an Observation, Procedure, or other Act occurs, or, depending on the mood, is supposed to occur, scheduled to occur, etc. It tells you when the labor was done for an Act. The activityTime includes the times of component actions (such as preparation and clean-up)For Procedures and SubstanceAdministrations, the activityTime can provide a needed administrative / scheduling function by providing a more complete time that needs to be anticipated for particular acts.</p>
						<p>Discussion: The activityTime is more of administrative rather than clinical use. The clinically relevant time is the effectiveTime. When an observation of a prior symptom is made, the activityTime describes the time the observation is made, as opposed to effectiveTime which is the time the symptom occurred. Thus the activityTime may be entirely different than the effectiveTime of the same Act. But even apart from clinical use cases, designers should first consider effectiveTime as the primary relevant time for an Act.</p>
						<p>The activityTime is a descriptive attribute, i.e., like effectiveTime, it always describes the Act event as it does or would occur, even when working with different moods. For example, when a procedure is requested, the activityTime describes the requested total time of the procedure. By contrast, the author Participation.time is inert, i.e., author participation time on an order specifies when the order was written and has nothing to do with when the event might actually occur.</p>
						<p>ActivityTime indicates when an Act occurs, not when an Act is recorded. Many applications track the time an observation is recorded rather than the precise time during which an observation is made, in which case Participation.time (e.g. of the Author) should be used. These recorded observations can take place during an encounter, and the time of the encounter often provides enough information so that activityTime isn't clinically relevant.</p>

					<attr id="Act-availabilityTime-att" name="availabilityTime" type="TS" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="TS"/>
						<p>The point in time at which information about Act-instance (regardless of mood) first became available to a system reproducing this Act. </p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> An Act might record that a patient had a right-ventricular myocardial infarction effective three hours ago (see Act.effectiveTime), but we may only know about this unusual condition a few minutes ago (Act.availabilityTime). Thus, any interventions from three hours ago until a few minutes ago may have assumed the more common left-ventricular infarction, which can explain why these interventions (e.g., nitrate administration) may not have been appropriate in light of the more recent knowledge.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> The availabilityTime is a subjective secondary piece of information added (or changed) by a system that reproduces this Act, and is not attributed to the author of the act statement (it would not be included in the material the author would attest to with a signature).  The system reproducing the Act is often not the same as the system originating the Act, but a system that received this Act from somewhere else, and, upon receipt of the Act, values the availabilityTime to convey the time since the users of that particular system could have known about this Act-instance.</p>
						<p>When communicating availabilityTime to another system, the availabilityTime of an Act A is attributed to the author of another Act B, that refers to or includes A. For example, if a medical record extract is compiled for reporting adverse events, availabilityTimes are attributed to the author who compiles that report.</p>

					<attr id="Act-confidentialityCode-att" name="confidentialityCode" type="SET&lt;CE&gt;" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..*" DomainSpec="Confidentiality" CodingStrength="CWE">
						<dtRef ref="SET_CE"/>
						<p>A code that controls the disclosure of information about this Act, regardless of mood.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> It is important to note that the necessary confidentiality of the medical record cannot be achieved solely through confidentiality codes to mask individual record items from certain types of users. There are two important problems with per-item confidentiality: one is inference and the other is the danger of holding back information that may be critical in a certain care situation.  Inference means that filtered sensitive information can still be assumed given the other information that was not filtered. The simplest form of inference is that even the existence of a test order for an HIV Western Blot test or a T4/T8 lymphocyte count is a strong indication for an existing HIV infection, even if the results are not known.  Very often, diagnoses can be inferred from medication, such as Zidovudin for treatment of HIV infections.  The problem of hiding individual items becomes especially difficult with current medications, since the continuing administration of the medication must be assured.</p>
						<p>To mitigate some of the inference-risk, aggregations of data should assume the confidentiality level of the most confidential action in the aggregation.</p>
					</attr>
					<attr id="Act-repeatNumber-att" name="repeatNumber" type="IVL&lt;INT&gt;" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="IVL_INT"/>
						<p>An interval of integer numbers stating the minimal and maximal number of repetitions of the Act.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> An oral surgeon's advice to a patient after tooth extraction might be: "replace the gauze every hour for 1 to 3 times until bleeding has stopped completely." This translates to repeatNumber with low boundary 1 and high boundary 3.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is a member of the workflow control suite of attributes. </p>
						<p>The number of repeats is additionally constrained by time. The act will repeat at least the minimal number of times and at most, the maximal number of times. Repetitions will also terminate when the time exceeds the maximal Act.effectiveTime, whichever comes first.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Usage:</emph> On an Act in Event mood, the repeatNumber is usally 1.  If greater than 1, the Act is representing a summary of several event occurrences occurring over the time interval described by effectiveTime</p>
						<p>To distinguish occurrences of acts within a sequence of repetitions, use ActRelationship.sequenceNumber</p>

					<attr id="Act-interruptibleInd-att" name="interruptibleInd" type="BL" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="BL"/>
						<p>An indicator specifying whether Act is interruptible by asynchronous events.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is part of the suite of workflow control attributes. Act events that are currently active can be interrupted in various ways. Interrupting events include: (1) when an explicit abort request is received against the Act (2) when the time allotted to this Act expires (timeout); (3) a "through condition" ceases to hold true for this Act (see ActRelationship.checkpointCode); (4) the Act is a component with the joinCode "kill" and all other components in that same group have terminated (see Act.joinCode); and (5) when a containing Act is being interrupted.  </p>
						<p>If an Act receives an interrupt and the Act itself is interruptible, but it has currently active component-Acts that are non-interruptible, the Act will be interrupted when all of its currently active non-interruptible component-acts have terminated.</p>

					<attr id="Act-levelCode-att" name="levelCode" type="CE" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1" DomainSpec="ActContextLevel" CodingStrength="CWE">
						<dtRef ref="CE"/>
						<p>Code specifying the level within a hierarchical Act composition structure and the kind of contextual information attached to composite Acts ("containers") and propagated to component Acts within those containers. The levelCode signifies the position within such a containment hierarchy and the applicable constraints.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> Readers should be aware that <emph role="strong">this attribute may be declared "obsolescent"</emph> in the next normative release of the HL7 RIM. An alternate representation of this concept using a specified hierarchy of Act classCode values is being considered. If the change is adopted, HL7's RIM maintenance procedures state that the levelCode would be declared "obsolescent" in the next RIM release, and then become "obsolete" in the release following that. Users are advised to check with the latest HL7 internal definitions of the RIM, before using this attribute.</p>
						<p>The levelCode concepts have been defined to meet specific health record transfer requirements. While these concepts are known to be applicable to some other types of transactions, they are not intended to be a complete closed list. Options exist for other sets of orthogonal levels where required to meet a business purpose (e.g. a multiple patient communication may be subdivided by a super-ordinate level of subject areas).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> The "extract level" and the "folder level" must contain data about a single individual, whereas the "multiple subject level" may contain data about multiple individuals. While "extract" can originate from multiple sources, a "folder" should originate from a single source. The "composition" level usually has a single author.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> The constraints applicable to a particular level may include differing requirements for participations (e.g. patient, source organization, author or other signatory), relationships to or inclusion of other Acts, documents or use of templates. The constraints pertaining to a level may also specify the permissible levels that may be contained as components of that level. Several nested levels with the same levelCode may be permitted, prohibited (or limited). Instances of the next subordinate level are usually permitted within any level but some levels may be omitted from a model and it may be permissible to skip several layers.</p>

						<p>An indicator specifying whether the Act can be manipulated independently of other Acts or whether manipulation of the Act can only be through a super-ordinate composite Act that has this Act as a component. By default the independentInd should be true.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> An Act definition is sometimes marked with independentInd=false if the business rules would not allow this act to be ordered without ordering the containing act group.</p>
						<p>An order may have a component that cannot be aborted independently of the other components.</p>

					<attr id="Act-uncertaintyCode-att" name="uncertaintyCode" type="CE" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..1" DomainSpec="ActUncertainty" CodingStrength="CNE">
						<dtRef ref="CE"/>
						<p>A code indicating whether the Act statement as a whole, with its subordinate components has been asserted to be uncertain in any way. </p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> Patient might have had a cholecystectomy procedure in the past (but isn't sure).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> Uncertainty asserted using this attribute applies to the combined meaning of the Act statement established by all descriptive attributes (e.g., Act.code, Act.effectiveTime, Observation.value, SubstanceAdministration.doseQuantity, etc.), and the meanings of any components.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph>This is not intended for use to replace or compete with uncertainty associated with Observation.value alone or other individual attributes of the class. Such pointed indications of uncertainty should be specified by applying the PPD, UVP or UVN data type extensions to the specific attribute. Particularly if the uncertainty is uncertainty of a quantitative measurement value, this must still be represented by a PPD&lt;PQ&gt; in the value and<emph role="strong">not</emph>using the uncertaintyCode. Also, when differential diagnoses are enumerated or weighed for probability, the UVP&lt;CD&gt; or UVN&lt;CD&gt; must be used, not the uncertaintyCode. The use of the uncertaintyCode is appropriate only if the entirety of the Act and its dependent Acts is questioned.</p>
						<p>Note that very vague uncertainty may be thought related to negationInd, however, the two concepts are really independent. One may be very uncertain about an event, but that does not mean that one is certain about the negation of the event.</p>

					<attr id="Act-reasonCode-att" name="reasonCode" type="SET&lt;CE&gt;" parentClass="Act-cls" Cardinality="0..*" DomainSpec="ActReason" CodingStrength="CWE">
						<dtRef ref="SET_CE"/>
						<p>A code specifying the motivation, cause, or rationale of an Act, when such rationale is not reasonably represented as an ActRelationship of type "has reason" linking to another Act.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> Example reasons that might qualify for being coded in this field might be: "routine requirement", "infectious disease reporting requirement", "on patient request", "required by law".</p>
						<p>Discussion </p>
						<p>Most reasons for acts can be clearly expressed by linking the new Act to another prior Act using an ActRelationship of type "has reason". This simply states that the prior Act is a reason for the new Act (see ActRelationship). The prior act can then be a specific existing act or a textual explanation. This works for most cases, and the more specific the reason data is, the more should this reason ActRelationship be used instead of the reasonCode. </p>
						<p>The reasonCode remains as a place for common reasons that are not related to a prior Act or any other condition expressed in Acts. Indicators that something was required by law or was on the request of a patient etc. may qualify. However, if that piece of legislation, regulation, or the contract or the patient request can be represented as an Act (and they usually can), the reasonCode should not be used.</p>

					<p>A directed association between a source Act and a target Act. ActRelationship on the same source Act are called the "outbound" act relationships of that Act. ActRelationships on the same target Act are called the "inbound" relationships of that Act. The meaning and purpose of an ActRelationship is specified in the ActRelationship.typeCode attribute. </p>
					<p>
						<emph>Examples:</emph> 1) An electrolyte observation panel may have sodium, potassium, pH, and bicarbonate observations as components. The composite electrolyte panel would then have 4 outbound ActRelationships of type "has component".</p>
					<p>2) The electrolyte panel event has been performed in fulfillment of an observation order. The electrolyte panel event has an outbound ActRelationship of type "fulfills" with the order as target.</p>
					<p>3) A Procedure "cholecystectomy" may be performed for the reason of an Observation of "cholelithiasis". The procedure has an outbound ActRelationship of type "has reason" to the cholelithiasis observation.</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Discussion:</emph> Consider every ActRelationship instance an arrow with a point (headed to the target) and a butt (coming from the source). The functions (sometimes called "roles") that source and target Acts play in that association are defined for each ActRelationship type differently. For instance in a composition relationship, the source is the composite and the target is the component. In a reason-relationship the source is any Act and the target is the reason or indication for the source-Act.</p>
					<p>The relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of the source act object. This means that the author of an Act-instance is also considered the author of all of the act relationships that have this Act as their source. There are no exceptions to this rule.</p>
					<p>See ActRelationship.typeCode for more overview of the different kinds of ActRelationships.</p>
					<p>The ActRelationship class is used to construct action plans and to represent clinical reasoning or judgments about action relationships. Prior actions can be linked as the reasons for more recent actions. Supporting evidence can be linked with current clinical hypotheses. Problem lists and other networks of related judgments about clinical events are represented by the ActRelationship link.</p>
					<p>One of the most commonly used ActRelationship types is "has component" to describe the composition and de-composition of Acts. The relationship type allows specifying detail of Acts to varying degrees.</p>
					<p>The composition relationship can group actions into "batteries," e.g., LYTES, CHEM12, or CBC, where multiple routine laboratory tests are ordered as a group. Some groupings, such as CHEM12, appear more arbitrary; others, such as blood pressure, seem to naturally consist of systolic and diastolic pressure.</p>
					<p>The composition relationships can be arranged in a sequence to form temporal and conditional (non-temporal) action plans (e.g., care plan, critical path, clinical trials protocol, drug treatment protocols). There is a group of attributes in both Act and ActRelationship that we refer to as the "workflow Control suite of attributes", and which allow the detailed specification of executable action plans. These attributes are:</p>
					<p>ActRelationship.sequenceNumber arranges the components of an Act as a sequence or as concurrent collections of components, expressing logical branches as well as parallel tasks (tasks carried out at the same time). The ActRelationship attributes splitCode and joinCode control how branches are selected or executable in parallel.</p>
					<p>Act.activityTime and ActRelationship.pauseQty allow one to explicitly time an action plan. Act.repeatNumber allows specifying act to repeat (loop).</p>
					<p>The ActRelationship type has-precondition allows plan steps to be conditional on the status or outcome of previous actions. The ActRelationhsip.checkpointCode specifies when pre-conditions of acts are tested during the flow of control.</p>
					<p>The composition ActRelationship allows these constructs to be organized in multiple layers of nesting to fully support workflow management. This nesting and the workflow control attributes are designed in analogy to a block-structured programming language with support for concurrency (fork, join, interrupts), and without "goto" statements. It is important to note that ALL plans are established through sequencing components (steps) in a composite act (block) as can be depicted in "Nassi-Schneiderman" diagrams (also known as "Chap Charts" or "Structograms"), not by chain-linking acts as in a flowchart diagram. </p>
					<p>With the composition relationship, the detail of Acts can be revealed to different levels for different purposes, without the structure of the Act hierarchy needing to be rearranged. This allows supporting multiple viewpoints on the same business processes. For instance, a billing-viewpoint of a laboratory test battery may be as a single billable act. A clinician's view of the same laboratory test battery is as a set of individual observations, where the ordering among the observations is irrelevant. The laboratory's view of this act will be more detailed, including action plan steps that are never reported to the clinician (e.g., centrifugation, decantation, aliquoting, running certain machines etc.). The laboratory's viewpoint warrants a thorough specification of action plans (that can be automated). During this specification, more and more nested sub-activities will be defined. Still the Act is the same, with varying degrees of detail uncovered in the de-composition relationship. </p>
					<p>We described the nature of varying detail saying that Acts are "fractal", ever more decomposable, just as the movements of a robotic arm can be decomposed in many fine control steps.</p>

							<emph>Discussion:</emph> The types of act relationships fall under one of 5 categories:</p>
						<p>1.) (De)-composition, with composite (source) and component (target).</p>
						<p>2.) Sequel which includes follow-up, fulfillment, instantiation, replacement, transformation, etc. that all have in common that source and target are Acts of essentially the same kind but with variances in mood and other attributes, and where the target exists before the source and the source refers to the target that it links back to.</p>
						<p>3.) Pre-condition, trigger, reason, contraindication, with the conditioned Act at the source and the condition or reason at the target.</p>
						<p>4.) Post-condition, outcome, goal and risk, with the Act at the source having the outcome or goal at the target.</p>

					<attr id="ActRelationship-contextControlCode-att" name="contextControlCode" type="CS" parentClass="ActRelationship-cls" Cardinality="0..1" DomainSpec="ContextControl" CodingStrength="CNE">
						<dtRef ref="CS"/>
						<p>A code that specifies how this ActRelationship contributes to the context of the current Act, and whether it may be propagated to descendent Acts whose association allows such propagation (see ActRelationship.contextConductionInd).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Rationale:</emph> In the interest of reducing duplication, humans tend to rely on context when interpreting information.  For example, when reading a report taken from a folder containing a patient's medical record, the reader will infer that the report deals with the patient, even if there is no direct reference to the patient on the form.  However, other pieces of information such as the author of the folder (the hospital that maintains it) may sometimes apply to the contents of the folder (e.g. a report generated by a doctor at the hospital) and other times not (e.g. a copy of a report from another institution).  Humans are quite good at making the necessary inferences about what context should be propagated from an item to something within that item.  However, incorrect inferences can occur (perhaps the report in the patient's record deals with a relative).  Furthermore, computers have substantially more difficulty making such inferences, even though they can be essential for decision-support systems.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute allows the clear specification of whether an association adds to the context associated with a particular item (e.g. adding an additional author) or whether it replaces (overrides) part of the context associated with a particular item (e.g. identifying a sole author, independent of the containing item).  It also indicates whether the association applies to only this act (non-propagating), or whether it may apply to derived acts as well (propagating).</p>
						<p>This attribute is closely linked with ActRelationship.contextConductionInd which determines whether associations that have been marked as propagating will actually be conducted to a child Act.  For example, an author participation might be marked as propagating, but still not conducted to a hyperlink to an external document.</p>
						<p>If no value or default is specified for this attribute (i.e. it is null), no inference can be made about context.  Systems must make their own assumptions on the basis of what data is being represented.  (For this reason, HL7 committees are encouraged to specify a default or fixed value for this attribute as part of their designs to ensure consistency of interpretation.)</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> An observation event has a patient participation marked "additive, propagating" (AP) and has component observation events linked through act relationships that are marked propagating. This means that the patient participation behaves as a patient participation of those component observation events in addition to the parent observation event.</p>
						<p>A composite order is created containing a pharmacy order as well as requests for several lab tests.  The composite order has participations for patient and author, and an act relationship to a diagnosis, all marked as "additive, propagating".  The "component" association between the composite order and the pharmacy order is marked as conductive (contextConductionInd is TRUE).  The pharmacy order has an author participation marked as "additive, non-propagating" (AN), and a reason relationship to a diagnosis, marked as "overriding, propagating" (OP). The order further has a relationship to a dispense event, marked as conductive, and an association to a drug protocol marked as non-conductive (contextConductionInd is FALSE).  The meaning would be as follows:</p>
						<p>The pharmacy order is interpreted as having the patient from the composite order, and having two authors (the one from the composite order, and the one on the pharmacy order itself).  The diagnosis for the pharmacy order would <emph role="strong">only</emph> be the diagnosis specified on the pharmacy order, not the one specified on the composite order.  The dispense event would carry the patient from the composite order and the diagnosis from the pharmacy order, but no author.  The drug protocol would not be associated with a patient, diagnosis or author.</p>

						<p>The identification of an Act as a parent or child (and therefore the direction context will be conducted) is determined by how the association is traversed when it is serialized.

						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Multiple components with the same sequenceNumber make a branch. Branches can be exclusive (case-switch) or can indicate parallel processes indicated by the splitCode.</p>

					<attr id="ActRelationship-priorityNumber-att" name="priorityNumber" type="REAL" parentClass="ActRelationship-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="REAL"/>
						<p>An integer specifying the relative preference for considering this  relationship before other like-typed relationships having the same source Act. Relationships with lower priorityNumber values are considered before and above those with higher values.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> For multiple criteria specifies which criteria are considered before others. For components with the same sequence number, specifies which ones are considered before others. Among alternatives or options that are being chosen by humans, the priorityNumber specifies preference.</p>

						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed and has preconditions these conditions are tested and if the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. At that time the pauseQuantity timer is started and the Act is executed after the pauseQuantity has elapsed.</p>

						<dtRef ref="CS"/>
						<p>A code specifying when in the course of an Act a precondition for the Act is evaluated (e.g., before the Act starts for the first time, before every repetition, after each repetition but not before the first, or throughout the entire time of the Act).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed, those with preconditions have their conditions tested; where the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. The repeatNumber may indicate that an Act may be repeatedly executed. The checkpointCode is specifies when the precondition is checked and is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages "while-do" vs. "do-while" or "repeat-until" vs. "loop-exit".</p>
						<p>For all checkpointCodes, except "end", preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute. </p>
						<p>When the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is "end", the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution. </p>
						<p>When the checkpointCode is "entry" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas "beginning" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition "loop" starts.</p>
						<p>The checkpointCode "through" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see Act.interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.</p>
						<p>The checkpointCode "exit" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan. Such exit criteria are sequenced with the other plan components using the ActRelationship.sequenceNumber.</p>

					<attr id="ActRelationship-splitCode-att" name="splitCode" type="CS" parentClass="ActRelationship-cls" Cardinality="0..1" DomainSpec="ActRelationshipSplit" CodingStrength="CNE">
						<dtRef ref="CS"/>
						<p>A code specifying how branches in an action plan are selected among other branches.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. The splitCode specifies whether a branch is executed exclusively (case-switch) or inclusively, i.e., in parallel with other branches. </p>
						<p>In addition to exclusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as "guard conditions" on the branch) are evaluated. A guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely execution of a branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.</p>
						<p>In exclusive wait branches, the first branch whose guard conditions turn true will be executed and all other branches abandoned. In inclusive wait branches some branches may already be executed while other branches still wait for their guard conditions to turn true.</p>

						<dtRef ref="CS"/>
						<p>A code specifying how concurrent Acts are resynchronized in a parallel branch construct.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. Branches are parallel if the splitCode specifies that more than one branch can be executed at the same time. The joinCode then specifies if and how the branches are resynchronized.</p>
						<p>The principal re-synchronization actions are (1) the control flow waits for a branch to terminate (wait-branch), (2) the branch that is not yet terminated is aborted (kill-branch), (3) the branch is not re-synchronized at all and continues in parallel (detached branch).</p>
						<p>A kill-branch is only executed if there is at least one active wait (or exclusive wait) branch. If there is no other wait branch active, a kill-branch is not started at all (rather than being aborted shortly after it is started). Since a detached branch is unrelated to all other branches, active detached branches do not protect a kill-branch from being aborted.</p>
					</attr>
					<attr id="ActRelationship-negationInd-att" name="negationInd" type="BL" parentClass="ActRelationship-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="BL"/>
						<p>An indicator that asserts that the meaning of the link is negated.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> If the relationship without negation specifies that Act A has Act B as a component, then the negation indicator specifies that Act A does <emph role="strong">not</emph> have Act B as a component. If B is a reason for A, then negation means that B is <emph role="strong">not</emph> a reason for A. If B is a pre-condition for A, then negation means that B is <emph role="strong">not</emph> a precondition for A.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> As the examples show, the use of this attribute is quite limited, notably contrast this with the Act.negationInd that actually requires that the described Act not exist, not be done, etc. whereas the ActRelationship.negationInd merely negates this relationship between source and target act, but does not change the meaning of each Act. This is mostly used for clarifying statements. </p>
						<p>Note also the difference between negation and the contrary. A contraindication is the contrary of an indication (reason) but not the negation of the reason. The fact that lower back pain is not a reason to prescribe antibiotics doesn't mean that antibiotics are contraindicated with lower back pain.</p>

						<p>A code specifying the logical conjunction of the criteria among all the condition-links of Acts (e.g., and, or, exclusive-or).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> All AND criteria must be true.  If OR and AND criteria occur together, one criterion out of the OR-group must be true and all AND criteria must be true also.  If XOR criteria occur together with OR and AND criteria, exactly one of the XOR criteria must be true, and at least one of the OR criteria and all AND criteria must be true.  In other words, the sets of AND, OR, and XOR criteria are in turn combined by a logical AND operator (all AND criteria and at least one OR criterion and exactly one XOR criterion). To overcome this ordering, Act criteria can be nested in any way necessary.</p>

						<p>This attribute indicates whether or not the source Act is intended to be interpreted independently of the target Act. The indicator cannot prevent an individual or application from separating the Acts, but indicates the author's desire and willingness to attest to the content of the source Act if separated from the target Act. Note that the default for this attribute will typically be "TRUE". Also note that this attribute is orthogonal and unrelated to the RIM's context/inheritance mechanism. If the context of an Act is propagated to nested Acts, it is assumed that those nested Acts are not intended to be interpreted without the propagated context.</p>

						<dtRef ref="CE"/>
						<p>A code indicating whether the specific relationship between the source and target Acts has been asserted to be uncertain in any way. </p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> A particular exposure event is suspected but not known to have caused a particular symptom.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> Uncertainty asserted using this attribute applies only to the relationship between two acts.  The certainty of the acts themselves should be conveyed via Act.uncertaintyCode.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> Note that very vague uncertainty may be thought related to ActRelationship.negationInd, however, the two concepts are really independent. One may be very uncertain about whether a relationship exists (e.g. not sure whether a drug contains an ingredient) an event, but that does not mean that one is certain about the negation of the relationship (e.g. A drug definitively does not contain an ingredient).</p>

				<cls id="Participation-cls" abst="False" name="Participation" superType="InfrastructureRoot-cls" primeSA="Acts-sbj" ballotStatus="NormativeStandard" ballotNumber="1">
					<p>An association between an Act and a Role with an Entity playing that Role. Each Entity (in a Role) involved in an Act in a certain way is linked to the act by one Participation-instance. The kind of involvement in the Act is specified by the Participation.typeCode.</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Examples:</emph> 1) Performers of acts (surgeons, observers, practitioners).</p>
					<p>2) Subjects of acts, patient, devices</p>
					<p>3) Locations</p>
					<p>4) Author, co-signer, witness, informant</p>
					<p>5) Addressee, information recipient</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Rationale:</emph> Participations represent performance while Roles represent competence. Participations specify the actual performance of an Entity in a certain Act, and thus a Participation is scoped by its specific Act. Conversely, Roles specify the competence of an Entity (i.e., how it may principally participate in what kinds of acts) irrespective of any individual Act.</p>
					<p>For example, the professional credentials of a person (Role) may be quite different from what a person actually does (Participation). A common example is interns and residents performing anesthesia or surgeries under (more or less) supervision of attending specialists. </p>
					<p>An Act can have multiple participations of the same type, which indicates collaborative activities or group involvement.  The notion of multiple performing Participations partially overlaps with sub-activities (Act components). Whenever multiple actors are involved in an act, each actor performs a different task (with the extremely rare exception of such symmetrical activities as two people pulling a rope from either end). Thus, the presence of multiple actors could be equally well represented as an act consisting of sub-acts where each act would have only one performing actor </p>
					<p>For example, a record of a surgical service may include the actors of type: (a) consenter, (b) primary surgeon, and (c) anesthetist. These three actors really perform different tasks, which can be represented as three related acts: (a) the consent, (b) the surgery proper, and (c) the anesthesia act in parallel to the surgery. If we used the sub-acts, the consenter, surgeon and anesthetist could simply be of actor type "performer." Thus the more sub-acts we use, the fewer different actor types we need to distinguish; conversely, the fewer sub-acts we use, the more distinct actor types we need.</p>
					<p>As a rule of thumb, sub-tasks should be considered instead of multiple actors when each sub-task requires special scheduling, or billing, or if overall responsibilities for the sub-tasks are different. In most cases, however, human resources are scheduled by teams (instead of individuals), billing tends to lump many sub-tasks together into one position, and overall responsibility often rests with one attending physician, chief nurse, or head of department. This model allows both the multi-actor and the multi-act approach to represent the business reality, with a slight bias towards "lumping" minor sub-activities into the overall act.</p>

							<emph>Constraints:</emph> This code, if specified at all, <emph role="strong">must not</emph> be in conflict with the Participation.typeCode. </p>

							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This code can accommodate the huge variety and nuances of functions that participants may perform in the act. The number and kinds of functions applicable depends on the special kind of act. E.g., each operation and method may require a different number of assistant surgeons or nurses.</p>

						<p>
							<emph>Rationale:</emph> Some parameters for tasks are uniquely defined by a specific model of equipment.  Most critical arguments of a task (e.g., container to operate on, positioning, timing, etc.) are specified in an HL7 standardized structure, and the parameter list would not be used for those.  The parameter list is used only for those parameters that cannot be standardized because they are uniquely defined for a specific model of equipment.

This information is not conveyed as part of the message.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> Parameters are only specified here if they are not included in a separate HL7 defined structure.  The parameters are a list of any data values interpreted by the device. The parameters should be typed with an appropriate HL7 data type (e.g., codes for nominal settings, such as flags, REAL and INT for numbers, TS for points in time, PQ for dimensioned quantities, etc.).

					<p>
						<emph role="strong">Definition: </emph> Exposure is an interaction that provides opportunity for transmission of an agent from an exposure source entity to an exposure target entity.  The agent is a physical (including energy), chemical or biological substance.  (Note: This class deals only with opportunity and not the outcome of the exposure, i.e. not all exposed parties will necessarily acquire the agent nor will all who acquire the agent necessarily experience actual harm or benefit.)</p>
					<p>
						<emph role="strong">Relationship to Substance Administration:  </emph>There is a relationship between Exposure and Substance Administration.  Normally when an entity has been exposed to an agent, and it is known the agent has affected the entity (e.g., caused a disease), then it is logically understood that the agent was introduced into the entity in some fashion.  Commonly, an agent is introduced via a Substance Administration of some sort.  In those instances, there is an act relationship (COMP where Exposure is the source act) between the Exposure and the Substance Administration.  Alternately, when a physician writes a prescription for a drug for a patient, the physician is effectively ordering the patient be exposed to a particular substance in the prescribed fashion (i.e., a specific type of substance administration).  However, this type of administration of the prescribed substance, while normally documented as a Substance Administration, is not typically documented with a related Exposure due to the detailed knowledge of cause and effect.</p>
					<p>
						<emph role="strong">Examples:  </emph>The following examples are provided to indicate what interactions are considered exposures vs. other types of Acts:</p>
					<list role="unordered">
						<item>A patient accidentally receives three times the recommended dose of their medication due to a dosing error.
<list role="unordered">
								<item>There is a substance administration.  Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with an associated exposure.</item>

						</item>
						<item>A patient accidentally is dispensed an incorrect medicine (clomiphene instead of clomipramine).  They have taken several doses before the mistake is detected.  They are therefore exposed to a medicine that there was no therapeutic indication for them to receive.
<list role="unordered">
								<item>There are several substance administrations.  Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with associated exposures.</item>

						<item>In a busy medical ward, a patient is receiving chemotherapy for a lymphoma.  Unfortunately, the IV infusion bag containing the medicine splits, spraying cytotoxic medication over the patient being treated and the patient in the adjacent bed.
<list role="unordered">
								<item>There are three substance administrations.  The first is the intended one (IV infusion) with its associated (implicit) exposure.  There is an incident with an associated substance administration to the same patient involving the medication sprayed over the patient as well as an associated exposure.  Additionally, the incident includes a substance administration involving the spraying of medication on the adjacent patient, also  with an associated exposure.</item>

Not understanding the registration and triage process, they sit in the waiting room for several hours before it is noticed that they have not booked in.  As soon as they are being processed, it is suspected that they are suffering from TB.  Vulnerable (immunosuppressed) patients who were sharing the waiting room with this patient may have been exposed to the tubercule bacillus, and must be traced for investigation.
<list role="unordered">
								<item>There is an exposure (or possibly multiple exposures) in the waiting room involving the refugee and everyone else in the waiting room during the period.  There might also be a number of known or presumed substance administrations (coughing) via several possible routes.

His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (whilst at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use.  Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice.  Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought.  The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring.

The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve.  The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patients abdominal cavity.  Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place.

						<p>A description of the number of instances of a product or service that is being billed or charged for.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> 4 hours, 4 mg, 4 boxes, and 15 each of a container of 1000 each, etc.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> Each InvoiceElement that is being charged or billed is identified by a charge or bill code (InvoiceElement.code).  In some situations, this code is a pre-coordinated code set and represents a container (e.g. UPC code for a container of 1000 pills and another UPC code for a container of the same pills but in a container of 100).  The UPC code is used in invoicing, but ratios are required to specify that only a portion of the container (e.g. bottle) is being billed or charged.  If the InvoiceElement does not reference a container, then the denominator is not specified.</p>
						<p>For example, 15 pills in a container size of 1000 pills.  In this case, the numerator can be expressed as "15 {pill}" or simply "15" and the denominator can be expressed as "1000 {bottle}" or simply "1000" (see discussion following for rationale of using descriptive text for countable units).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph>
						</p>
						<p>The unit of measure is restricted to a measurable unit such as liters, milligrams and hours. Non-measurable, but countable units such as boxes, packages, visits, pills and containers must not be specified using the unit component of the PQ data type, except as an annotation, marked by {xxx}. Refer to Data Types Part II Unabridged Specification, Appendix A :Unified Code for Units of Measure.</p>
						<p>Specification of countable units can be handled with the following techniques:</p>
						<p>(1) specify the countable unit in the InvoiceElement.code. That is, a specific InvoiceElement.code would indicate that the item referenced by the act represents a box of 20 items. There would be a different InvoiceElement.code for a box of 40 items, and so on.</p>
						<p>For example, if the InvoiceElement.code represents a box of 20 items, and the InvoiceElement.unitQuantity = 2 (no units), then this represents 2 boxes of 20 items for a total of 40 items.</p>
						<p>(2) If more detail is required (e.g. to describe the composition, packaging, manufacturer of a product), then use a participation (typeCode = "PRD"), and a combination of role and entity classes to describe the details of the packaging.</p>

				<cls id="Observation-cls" abst="False" name="Observation" superType="Act-cls" classCode="OBS" primeSA="Acts-sbj" ballotStatus="NormativeStandard" ballotNumber="1">
					<p>An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The <emph role="strong">code</emph> attribute of Observation and the <emph role="strong">value</emph> attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Discussion:</emph> Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a "variable" (a named feature that can assume a value); hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter. </p>
					<p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed ("results" or "answers"); and those "results" or "answers" are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. </p>
					<p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p>
					<p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations. </p>
					<p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. </p>
					<p>Clinical documents commonly have 'Subjective' and 'Objective' findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain 'Assessments', which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. </p>
					<p>Examples of Observation:</p>
					<list role="unordered">

						<dtRef ref="ANY"/>
						<p>Information that is assigned or determined by the observation action. </p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> The Observation.value, if not otherwise constrained, can be of any data type.</p>
						<p>The appropriate data type of the Observation.value varies with the kind of Observation and can generally be described in Observation definitions or in a simple relation that pairs Act.codes to value data types.</p>
						<p>The following guidelines govern the choice of the appropriate value data type.</p>
						<p>(1) Quantitative measurements use the data type Physical Quantity (PQ) in general. A PQ is essentially a real number with a unit. This is the general preference for all numeric values, subject to a few exceptions listed below. </p>
						<p>Numeric values <emph role="strong">must not</emph> be communicated as simply a character string (ST). </p>
						<p>(2) Titer (e.g., 1:64) and very few other ratios use the data type Ratio (RTO). For titers, the ratio would be a ratio of two integer numbers (e.g., 1:128). Other ratios may relate different quantitative data types, such as a "price" specified in Physical Quantity over Monetary Amount.</p>
						<p>Sometimes by local conventions titers are reported as just the denominator (e.g., 32 instead of 1/32). Such conventions are confusing and <emph role="strong">should</emph> be converted into correct ratios in HL7 messages. </p>
						<p>(3) Index values (a number without unit) uses the Real Number (REAL) data type. When a quantity does not have a proper unit, one can just send the number as a real number. Alternatively one can use a PQ with a dimensionless unit (e.g., 1 or %). An integer number should only be sent when the measurement is by definition an integer, which is an extremely rare case and then is most likely an ordinal (see below).</p>
						<p>(4)  Ranges (e.g., &lt;3; 12-20) must be expressed as Interval of Physical Quantity (IVL&lt;PQ&gt;) or intervals of other quantity data types.</p>
						<p>Sometimes such intervals are used to report the uncertainty of measurement value. For uncertainty there are dedicated data type extensions available. </p>
						<p>(5) Ordinals (e.g., +, ++, +++; or I, IIa, IIb, III, IV) use the Coded Ordinal (CO) data type. </p>
						<p>(6) Nominal results ("taxons", e.g., organism type). use any of the coded data types (CD, CE) that specify at least a code and a coding system, and optionally original text, translations to other coding systems and sometimes qualifiers. </p>
						<p>(7) Imaging results use the Encapsulated Data (ED) type. The encapsulated data type allows one to send an image (e.g., chest X-ray) or a movie (e.g., coronary angiography, cardiac echo) as alternatively inline binary data or as a reference to an external address where the data can be downloaded on demand.</p>
						<p>(8) Waveforms can be sent using the Correlated Observation Sequences templates that provide all the data in an HL7 framework. In addition one can use the Encapsulated Data (ED) data type to send waveforms in other than HL7 formats or to refer to waveform data for on-demand download. </p>
						<p>(9) The character string data type may exceptionally be used to convey formalized expressions that do not fit in any of the existing data types. However, the string data type <emph role="strong">must not</emph> be used if the meaning can be represented by one of the existing data types. </p>
						<p>(10) Timestamps <emph role="strong">should not</emph> be sent in Observations if there are more appropriate places to send those, e.g., usually as Act.effectiveTime of some act. (E.g., "specimen received in lab" is in the effectiveTime of an Act describing the specimen transport to the lab, not in an Observation.</p>
						<p>(11) Sets of values of any data type, enumerated sets as well as intervals, are often used for Observation criteria (event-criterion mood) to specify "normal ranges" or "decision ranges" (for alerts) etc.</p>
						<p>(12) For sequences of observations (repeated measurements of the same property during a relatively short time) a Sequence (LIST) data type is used. Refer to the Correlated Observation Sequences specification for more detail.</p>
						<p>(13) Uncertainty of values is specified using the Probability and Probability Distribution data type extensions (UVP, PPD). If a statistical sample is reported with absolute frequencies of categories a Bag collection (BAG) can be used efficiently.</p>

						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> Blood pressure measurement method: arterial puncture vs. sphygmomanometer (Riva-Rocci), sitting vs. supine position, etc.   </p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> In all observations the method is already partially specified by the Act.code. In this case, the methodCode <emph role="strong">need not</emph> be used at all. The methodCode <emph role="strong">may</emph> still be used to identify this method more clearly in addition to what is implied from the Act.code. However, an information consumer system or process <emph role="strong">should not</emph> depend on this methodCode information for method detail that is implied by the Act.code. </p>
						<p>If the methodCode is used to express method detail that is also implied by the Act.code, the methodCode <emph role="strong">must not</emph> be in conflict with the implied method of the Act.code.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> In all observations the method is already partially specified by simply knowing the kind of observation (observation definition, Act.code) and this implicit information about the method does not need to be specified in Observation.methodCode. For example, many LOINC codes are defined for specific methods as long as the method makes a practical difference in interpretation. Thus, using LOINC, the difference between susceptibility studies using the "minimal inhibitory concentration" (MIC) or the "agar diffusion method" (Kirby-Baur) are specifically assigned different codes. The methodCode therefore is only an additional qualifier to specify what may not be known already from the Act.code.</p>
						<p>Also, some variances in methods may be tied to the particular device used. The methodCode should not be used to identify the specific device or test-kit material used in the observation. Such information about devices or test-kits should be associated with the observation as "device" participations.</p>

						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> Most observation target sites are implied by the observation definition and Act.code, or Observation.value. For example, "heart murmur" always has the heart as target. This attribute is used only when the observation target site needs to be refined, to distinguish right and left etc. </p>
						<p>If the subject of the Observation is something other than a human patient or animal, the attribute is used analogously to specify a structural landmark of the thing where the act focuses. For example, if the subject is a lake, the site could be inflow and outflow, etc. If the subject is a lymphatic node, "hilus," "periphery," etc. would still be valid target sites.</p>

Whether the bodily alteration is appreciated or intended as beneficial to the subject is likewise irrelevant, what counts is that the act is essentially an alteration of the physical condition of the subject.</p>
					<p>The choice between representations for real activities is based on whether the specific properties of procedure are applicable and whether the activity or activity step's necessary post-condition is the physical alteration. For example, taking an x-ray image may sometimes be called "procedure", but it is not a Procedure in the RIM sense for an x-ray image is not done to alter the physical condition of the body.</p>
					<p>Many clinical activities combine Acts of Observation and Procedure nature into one composite. For instance, interventional radiology (e.g., catheter directed thrombolysis) does both observing and treating, and most surgical procedures include conscious and documented Observation steps. These clinical activities therefore are best represented by multiple component acts each of the appropriate type.</p>

						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> For any Procedure there may be several different methods to achieve by and large the same result, but may be important to know when interpreting a report more thoroughly (e.g., cholecystectomy: open vs. laparoscopic).  Method concepts can be "pre-coordinated" in the Act definition. There are many possible methods, which all depend heavily on the particular kind of Procedure, so that defining a vocabulary domain of all methods is difficult. However, a code system might be designed such that it specifies a set of available methods for each defined Procedure concept. Thus, a user ordering a Procedure could select one of several variances of the act by means of the method code. Available method variances may also be defined in a master service catalog for each defined Procedure. In act definition records (Act.moodCode = DEF) the methodCode attribute is a set of all available method codes that a user may select while ordering, or expect while receiving results.</p>

					<p>A public health case is an Observation representing a condition or event that has a specific significance for public health. Typically it involves an instance or instances of a reportable infectious disease or other condition. The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health. An outbreak involving multiple individuals may be considered as a type of public health case. A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = "definition") includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. There are also case definitions for outbreaks. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment. Examples include AIDS, toxic-shock syndrome, and salmonellosis and their associated indicators that are used to define a case.</p>

						<p>The amount of the therapeutic agent or other substance given at one administration event.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> The dose may be specified either as a physical quantity of active ingredient (e.g. 200 mg) or as the count of administration-units (e.g., tablets, capsules, "eaches"). Which approach is chosen depends upon the player of the 'consumable' participation (which identifies the drug being administered). If the consumable has a non-countable dosage form (e.g. measured in milligram or litre) then the dose must be expressed in those units. If the consumable has a countable dosage form (tablets, capsules, "eaches"), then the dose must be expressed as a dimensionless count (i.e., with no other unit of measure specified).</p>
						<p>The unit of measure is restricted to a measurable unit such as milliliters and milligrams. Non-measurable, but countable units such as tablets and capsules must not be specified using the unit component of the PQ data type, except as an annotation, marked by {xxx}.

							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This is appropriate for continuously divisible dose forms (e.g., liquids, gases). If specified as an interval, the rate should be anywhere in the specified range.

						<p>This attribute identifies the expected quantity to be consumed over a period of time.  It is used as a verification check on the values specified for other values.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute should not generally be used; it is only provided for a special purpose. In some countries, especially Japan, there is a regulatory requirement to note the total daily dose on the prescription and associated documentation.  The purpose of this requirement obviously is to encourage and facilitate reviewing the total dose prescribed to avoid over- (or under-) dosage.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph>
						</p>
						<p>With Erythromycin 250 mg 1 tablet 3 times a day one can calculate the total daily dose as "doseCheckQuantity = doseQuantity (1) * Ingredient.quantity (250 mg) * effectiveTime  (3 /d) = 750 mg/1d."</p>
						<p>For an intravenous example, this term would be "doseCheckQuantity = doseQuantity (100 ml) * Ingredient.quantity (5mg/L) / rateQuantity (1 h) = 0.5 mg/h" which can be calculated on a daily basis as "doseCheckQuantity =  0.5 mg/h * 24 h/d = 12 mg/d."</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Rationale:</emph> Rather than defining a "total daily dose" attribute as HL7 v2.3 did, we define this general purpose doseCheckQuantity attribute of the Ratio (RTO) data type. </p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> invariant(SubstanceAdministration med, RTO max) where med.doseCheckQuantity.contains(max) {max.numerator.compares(med.doseQuantity); max.denominator.compares(1 s);} Numerator must be in units comparable to doseQuantity and denominator must be a measurement of time.</p>

							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is particularly useful where the allowed dosage is specified as a range or the timing is variable or PRN (as needed).  It provides an overall limit on the quantity that may be administered in a period of time.

						<p>
							<emph>Rationale: </emph>In the given example, without an administrationUnitCode the doseQty = 1 would mean that the entire inhaler bottle is to be emptied upon a single administration event.

							<emph>Examples:</emph> With undetermined kinds, the quantity is but a reference quantity for the specification of the proportion of ingredients or components (e.g. through a has-part, has-ingredient, or has-content Role). For example, a kind of group with 60% females is Person(quantity = 100) has-part Person(quantity = 60; sex = female). Amoxicillin 500 mg per tablet is Material(Tablet, quantity = 1) has-ingredient Material(Amoxicillin, quantity = 500 mg). Glucose 5% (D5W) is Material(D5W, quantity = 1 kg) has-ingredient Material(Glucose, quantity = 50 g).</p>
						<p>Material-specific quantity relations are expressed using the fact that the data type of this attribute is a set of physical quantity (SET&lt;PQ&gt;). If more than one quantity value are specified in this set, each element in this set is considered to specify the same amount of the material. For example, for one liter of water one could use the set 1 L, 1 kg, 55.56 mol to specify the volume, mass, and amount of substance for the same amount of water, this is equivalent with specifying the mass density (volumic mass 1 kg/L) and the molar mass (18 g/mol). For Glucose one could specify 180 g, 1 mol according to the molar mass (180 g/mol).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> When the Entity instance is a portion of a substance, the quantity specifies the amount of that substance comprised by that portion. For an undetermined substance (kind) the quantity serves two purposes at the same time: (a) it provides a means of relations between quantities specific for that substance, and (b) it is a reference quantity for the specification of ingredients or components. In all cases, the quantity is an extensive "amount" kind of quantity (e.g., number, length, volume, mass, surface area, energy, etc.). Note that most relative or fractional quantities are not amounts, in particular, mass fraction, substance concentration, mass ratios, percentages, etc. are not extensive quantities and are prohibited values for this attribute.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> For Entities with determinerCode = INSTANCE, the quantity is 1. For an Entity with determinerCode = QUANTIFIED_KIND, the quantity is the number of individual members in the group; for an Entity with a determinerCode = KIND, the value is undetermined.</p>

					<p>A competency of the Entity playing the Role as identified, defined, guaranteed, or acknowledged by the Entity that scopes the Role.</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Discussion:</emph> An Entity participates in an Act as in a particular Role. Note that a particular entity in a particular role can participate in an act in many ways. Thus, a Person in the role of a practitioner can participate in a patient encounter as a rounding physician or as an attending physician. The Role defines the competency of the Entity irrespective of any Act, as opposed to Participation, which are limited to the scope of an Act.</p>
					<p>Each role is "played" by one Entity, called the "player" and is "scoped" by another Entity, called the "scoper". Thus the Role of "patient" may be played by a person and scoped by the provider organization from which the patient will receive services. Similarly, the employer scopes an "employee" role.</p>
					<p>The identifier of the Role identifies the Entity playing the role in that role. This identifier is assigned by the scoping Entity to the player. The scoping Entity need not have issued the identifier, but it may have re-used an existing identifier for the Entity to also identify the Entity in the Role with the scoper.</p>

						<dtRef ref="SET_CE"/>
						<p>A code that controls the disclosure of information about this Role with respect to the playing Entity..</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> It is important to note that the necessary confidentiality of the medical record cannot be achieved solely through confidentiality codes to mask individual record items from certain types of users. There are two important problems with per-item confidentiality: one is inference and the other is the danger of holding back information that may be critical in a certain care situation.  Inference means that filtered sensitive information can still be assumed given the other information that was not filtered. The simplest form of inference is that even the existence of a test order for an HIV Western Blot test or a T4/T8 lymphocyte count is a strong indication for an existing HIV infection, even if the results are not known.  Very often, diagnoses can be inferred from medication, such as Zidovudin for treatment of HIV infections.  The problem of hiding individual items becomes especially difficult with current medications, since the continuing administration of the medication must be assured.</p>
						<p>To mitigate some of the inference-risk, aggregations of data should assume the confidentiality level of the most confidential action in the aggregation.</p>
					</attr>
					<attr id="Role-quantity-att" name="quantity" type="RTO" parentClass="Role-cls" Cardinality="0..1">
						<dtRef ref="RTO"/>
						<p>A ratio (numerator : denominator) specifying the relative quantities of the Entity playing the Role in the Entity scoping the Role, used for Roles that represent composition relationships between the scoping and playing Entities.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Examples:</emph> 1.) This syrup's (scoper) ingredients include 160 mg (numerator) Acetaminophen (player) per tablespoon (denominator).</p>
						<p>2.) This herd (scoper) consists of 500 (numerator) cattle (player).</p>
						<p>3.) A VAX 6630 computer (scoper) has 3 (numerator) CPUs (player) as parts.</p>
						<p>4.) This package (scoper) contains 100 (numerator) pills (player).</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> In composition-relationships (e.g., has-parts, has-ingredient, has-content) the Role.quantity attribute specifies that a numerator amount of the target entity is comprised by a denominator amount of the source entity of such composition-relationship. For example, if a box (source) has-content 10 eggs (target), the relationship quantity is 10:1; if 0.6 mL contain 75 mg of FeSO4 the ingredient relationship quantity is 75 mg : 0.6 mL. Both numerator and denominator must be amount quantities (extensive quantities, i.e., a count number, mass, volume, amount of substance, amount of energy, etc.).</p>

					<attr id="Role-positionNumber-att" name="positionNumber" type="LIST&lt;INT&gt;" parentClass="Role-cls" Cardinality="0..*">
						<dtRef ref="LIST_INT"/>
						<p>An integer specifying the position of the Entity playing the Role with respect to the Entity that scopes the Role.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Discussion:</emph> This attribute is primarily used with respect to containment roles.  For example, some containers have discrete positions in which content may be located. Depending on the geometry of the container, the position may be referenced as a scalar ordinal number, or as a vector of ordinal numbers (coordinates). Coordinates always begin counting at 1.</p>
						<p>Some containers may have customary ways of referring to the positions or no way at all. In the absence of any specific regulation for a specific container type, the rule of thumb is that the coordinate that is changed earlier is positioned first. For an automated blood chemistry analyzer with a square shaped tray, this means that the first coordinate is the one in which direction the tray moves at each step and the second coordinate is the one in which the tray moves only every 10 (or so) steps.</p>

					<p>A role played by a device when the device is used to administer therapeutic agents (medication and vital elements) into the body, or to drain material (e.g., exudates, pus, urine, air, blood) out of the body.</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Discussion:</emph> In general, Access is a Role of a ManufacturedMaterial or Device, something specifically manufactured or created to serve that purpose, such as a catheter or cannula inserted into a compartment of the body. </p>
					<p>Devices in the role of an Access are typically used in intake/outflow observations, and in medication routing instructions. Microbiologic observations on the material itself or on fluids coming out of a drain, are also common.</p>
					<p>
						<emph>Rationale:</emph> The Access role primarily exists in order to describe material actually deployed as an access, and not so much the fresh material as it comes from the manufacturer. For example, in supply ordering a box of catheters from a distributor, it is not necessary to use the Access  role class, since the material attributes will usually suffice to describe and identify the product for the order. But the Access role is used to communicate about the maintenance, intake/outflow, and due replacement of tubes and drains.</p>

						<p>
							<emph>Constraints:</emph> The coding system is the same as for Procedure.approachSiteCode; indeed the Access.approachSiteCode has been copied from the Procedure class into the Access role class. The value of the Access.approachSiteCode should be identical to the value of the Procedure.approachSiteCode of an associated access placement procedure.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Rationale:</emph> Since accesses are typically placed for a considerable period of time and since the access is used as a resource of many acts, the access approach site becomes an important identifying attribute of the access itself (as opposed to merely being an attribute of the placement procedure).</p>

							<emph>Constraints:</emph> The coding system is the same as for Procedure.targetSiteCode; indeed the Access.targetSiteCode has been copied from the Procedure class into the Access role class. The value of the Access.targetSiteCode should be identical to the value of the Procedure.targetSiteCode of an associated access placement procedure.</p>
						<p>
							<emph>Rationale:</emph> Since accesses are typically placed for a considerable period of time and since the access is used as a resource of many acts, the target site becomes an important identifying attribute of the access itself (as opposed to merely being an attribute of the placement procedure). The target site is important information that determines what kinds of substances may or may not be administered (e.g., special care to avoid medication injections into an arterial access).</p>

					<p>
						<emph>Examples:</emph> Consider a refined message information model (RMIM) contains Act with the specializations of Observation and PatientEducationAct, where PatientEducationAct is conceptually a direct specialization ("clone") of Act. In this case, the ActHeir class is used as the basis of the PatientEducationAct clone rather than the Act RIM class itself.

						<emph>Discussion:</emph> Notably, although it is used to represent Acts that are not otherwise sub-classed in the RIM, the ActHeir class does not reflect any conceptual modeling principle according to which generalizations must all be abstract and only leaf-specializations (like ActHeir) could be instantiated.

						<emph>Rationale:</emph> It has been discovered that one cannot create an HMD choice structure for a set of classes, all of which are sub-types of Act, Role or Entity, but for which there is not a defined physical class.

			<head>Appendix - Overview of the RIM</head>
			<div2 id="RIM-Purpose">
				<head>Purpose</head>
				<p>This document is meant to serve as an "Executive Summary" of the basic concepts and rationale behind the design and development of the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM).  It is not meant to be an "application guide" on RIM usage although several partial examples of usage are presented when they are deemed helpful in explaining the fundamental design and development concepts of the RIM.</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="RIM-OV1">
				<head>Overview</head>
				<p>A Reference Information Model (RIM) is constructed to facilitate consistent sharing and usage of data across multiple "local" contexts. In general, the broader the scope of interest, the more important it is to make explicit all assumptions about a topic or domain-of-interest.   The HL7 Version 3 RIM is designed to provide a unified framework for, and to serve as a comprehensive source of, all information used by an HL7 Specification.  The RIM specifically and unambiguously articulates both the explicit definitions of healthcare concepts - the "things of interest" to the world of healthcare information systems - and the relationships (aka "associations") between these concepts-of-interest.</p>
				<p>HL7 V3 Specifications (e.g. HL7 V3 messages, structured documents, etc.) permit loosely-coupled information systems to interoperate (i.e. exchange data) in a variety of healthcare delivery contexts including those found in disparate provider organizations, perspectives, and jurisdictions. The scope of the HL7 RIM therefore includes all of the information that is required to be sent between, and processed by, participating healthcare information systems.  In addition, it should be noted that the RIM does not model (nor need to model) information stored by a given healthcare information system but never transmitted to another system. </p>
				<p>The RIM is expressed using a visual modeling syntax based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML).  (Specific variances between "standard UML" and "HL7 UML" as manifest in the RIM, such as the placement of association names, are currently under review by the HL7 Modeling and Methodology Technical Committee with the goal of moving to a maximum alignment between the two syntaxes.)    HL7 also maintains a database ("RIM repository") containing the details of each RIM concept, attribute, and association including the item's rationale, definition, constraints, and edit/change history.  At some point in the future, any or all of this information may be formally published in an HL7-specific UML profile.   </p>
				<p>It is important to note that the RIM is not intended to be a logical or physical model of a database, a design for a particular vendor's information system, or a perspective focused on a particular healthcare organization or enterprise. In fact, the RIM is not intended to represent a particular set of HL7 messages, but rather the collective universe of data and relationships from which any relevant HL7 message could be constructed.  Specific users of the RIM are expected to utilize relevant portions of the RIM as needed, adopting its content to their own information modeling needs and notations. </p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="RIM-Rationale">
				<head>The Rationale Behind the RIM's Design</head>
				<p>The overarching structure of the RIM is based on six "core" classes:  Act, Entity, Role, Participation, ActRelationship, and RoleLink.  Each class is defined in Section 1.4.  Following is a discussion of the fundamental thinking behind, and basic usage guidelines for, the six classes and their inter-relationships.</p>
				<p>The HL7 RIM identifies two major "high-level" concepts that are fundamental to understanding the world of healthcare information: intentional "actions" or "services" (Acts), and "people, places and things" that are of interest in the world of healthcare (Entities).</p>
				<p>The concept "Act" (and its subclasses) represents all of the intentional actions documented by a healthcare professional in either a clinical or administrative context.  The presence of the Act class as one of the core RIM classes is a reflection of HL7's view that "from a messaging/system communication perspective, healthcare consists of a series of attributed, intentional actions. Thus, instances of the class/concept Act include both clinical observations (e.g. patient temperature) and interventions (e.g. administer medication), and administrative actions (e.g. admit patient).  Note that in this "act-centered" view of healthcare, the act of an observation takes on two seemingly contradictory meanings:  "the act of recognizing and documenting a particular fact," and "the description of the thing observed."  In other words, an instance of an Observation Act represents both the attributed act of observing and the results of the observation.  Both aspects of this expanded definition of an Observation Act are captured by specific attributes of the class Act or its subclass Observation.</p>
				<p>The concept "Entity" (and its subclasses) includes all living subjects (e.g. persons, animals), organizations (e.g. formal and informal), materials (e.g. durable and non-durable goods, food, tissue, containers,), and places that may be of interest in a healthcare messaging context.  It should be noted that the concept of "collection of information" (e.g. a medical record) is <emph role="strong">not </emph> a instance or subclass of Entity, but is instead considered as a collection of attributed Acts.</p>
				<p>The RIM places two additional classes - Role and Participation - between Act and Entity.  The Role class models several important concepts that are prevalent in the healthcare delivery domain.  First, Role captures the fact that the various "static" entities may "temporally" assume one or more "roles" (e.g. patient, primary care physician, responsible party, Registered Nurse etc.) in a particular healthcare context.  Second, the concepts of "capability" (e.g. Advanced Cardiac Life Support) and "certification" (e.g. Licensed Practical Nurse) are also modeled using instances of the Role class.  Finally, careful examination of the multiplicity (0..1) and names (scoper, player) of the <emph role="strong">two</emph> associations between Entity and Role reveals that the Role class can be used to "group" instances of Entity.</p>
				<p>It is important to distinguish the concept of Entity-in-a-Role from the Act-specific concept of "the function-based role played by an Entity-in-a-Role in the context of a specific Act."  These semantics are modeled using instances of the Participation class.  For example, an Anesthesia Resident (Entity-in-a-Role) administers anesthesia (Participation as "provider" in the Act "administer anesthesia") to a patient (Participation as a 'recipient" in the Act "administer anesthesia."  <emph role="strong">Note that the absence of a direct association between the Participation and Entity classes is a manifestation of an underlying HL7 RIM assumption that all instances of Entity involved in an Act are participating in the Act in a particular Role.</emph>
				</p>
				<p>In summary, both the Participation and the Role classes are necessary to fully model the complex semantics that exist between instances of Entity and Act, and a concise summary of the HL7 RIM's view of healthcare can be stated as follows:  <emph role="strong">At the highest level of abstraction, healthcare consists of a series of intentional, attributed Acts performed to, by, on behalf of, utilizing or in some way involving one or more instances of a Participating ("as primary provider," etc.) Entity-in-a-Role ("John Smith in the role of Patient"). </emph>
				</p>
				<p>The two remaining classes in the RIM - ActRelationship and RoleLink - are used to "associate" or "link" instances of the class with which it is associated.  The class RoleLink is used to establish a "dependency-based link" (e.g. accountability, chain-of-trust, etc.) between <emph role="strong">two </emph>instances of an Entity-in-a-Role.  The semantics of ActRelationship are explained below.</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="RIM-LinkActs">
				<head>Linking Acts Together:  The Semantics of ActRelationship</head>
				<p>An understanding of the semantics and application of ActRelationship begins with, an understanding of the "fractal" or "robotic arm" nature of a set of Acts.  This perspective is, in turn, best viewed from the overarching framework of the categorization of three types of "collecting relationships" represented by instances of ActRelationship:  whole/part (e.g. lab or test batteries (see the discussion of the "robotic arm" below); rule-based (e.g. care plans, protocols, etc.); and cognitive actions (e.g. judgment, renaming, replacement, subsumption, supported by/reason for, etc.).</p>
				<p>Regarding the "fractal" or "robotic arm" discussion, As mentioned above, instances of ActRelationship can be used to model the "fractal" or  "robotic arm" notion behind a "whole/part" relationship.  Consider a surgical procedure such as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  The procedure may be represented as a single instance of Act, or, alternatively, as a "collection" of (partially ordered) instances of Act each of which is a finer granularity than the entire procedure, e.g. obtain consent, administer pre-op medication, administer anesthesia (throughout the surgical procedure), make the incision, etc.  In turn, for any of the more finely granulated actions just mentioned, further granulation/decomposition may occur.  The degree of granularity is clearly dependent on the context of the action(s) and the interest level/perspective of the party performing (or not performing) the decomposition.  Figure 1 shows a "surgeon's-eye view" of some of the instances of Act and ActRelationship for the exemplar cholecystectomy..</p>
				<p>
					<graphic source="./Graphics/RIM_IntroFig1.gif" alt="Example of sequential plan construction for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Edged boxes are Act instances (all in definition, or 'master' mood.)  Rounded boxes are ActRelationship instances of type: has-component.  The sequenceNumber attribute orders the relationships into a sequence.  Each act can in turn be decomposed into plan-components."/>
				</p>
				<p>In summary, the classes Act and ActRelationship have been designed to allow for representing the rich semantics of each of three types of collections mentioned above at whatever coarseness or fineness of granularity is appropriate to the specific messaging context.  In addition, the various of types of collections and levels of granularity represented by instances of ActRelationship can (and will) be expected to be used to collectively capture the complex semantics of clinical reasoning, e.g. an instance of ActRelationship (e.g. "supported by") could be used to form a link from an instance of an observation Act representing a specific lab test (e.g. sedimentation rate = 48 to an instance of an observation Act representing a particular diagnosis (e.g. DX = Systemic Lupus Erythematosus).</p>

			<div2 id="RIMCoreClasses">
				<head>Definitions of the Six Core Rim Classes</head>
				<div3 id="ActDef">
					<head>Act</head>
					<p>An <loc href="#Act-cls">Act </loc> is an action of interest that has happened, can happen, is happening, is intended to happen, or is requested/demanded to happen. An act is an intentional action in the business domain of HL7. Healthcare (and any profession or business) is constituted of intentional actions. An Act instance is a record of such an intentional action. 
</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="EntityDef">
					<head>Entity</head>
					<p>An <loc href="#Entity-cls">Entity</loc> is a class or specific instance of a physical thing or an organization/group of physical things capable of participating in Acts; an artifact.  This includes living subjects, organizations, material, and places. The Entity hierarchy encompasses human beings, organizations, living organisms, devices, pharmaceutical substances, etc. It does not include events/acts/actions, the definition of things, or the roles that things can play (e.g. patient, provider).
</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="RoleDef">
					<head>Role</head>
					<p>A <loc href="#Role-cls">Role</loc> is a categorization of competency of the Entity that plays the Role as defined by the Entity that scopes the Role.</p>
					<p>An Entity, in a particular Role, can participate in an Act. Note that a particular entity in a particular role can participate in an act in many ways. Thus, a Person in the role of a practitioner can participate in a patient encounter as a rounding physician or as an attending physician. The Role defines the competency of the Entity irrespective of any Act, as opposed to Participation, which is limited to the scope of an Act.</p>
					<p>Each role is 'played' by one Entity (the Entity that is in the role) and is usually 'scoped' by another. Thus the Role of 'patient' is played by (usually) a person and scoped by the provider from whom the patient will receive services. Similarly, the employer scopes an Employee role.
</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="ParticipationDef">
					<head>Participation</head>
					<p>A <loc href="#Participation-cls">Participation</loc> is an association between a Role and an Act.  The Participation represents the involvement of the Entity playing the Role with regard to the associated Act.  A single Role may participate in multiple Acts and a single Act may have multiple participating Roles.  A single Participation is always an association between a particular Role and a particular Act. Participation is limited to the scope of the Act, as opposed to Role, which defines the competency of an Entity irrespective of any Act.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="ActRelationshipDef">
					<head>ActRelationship</head>
					<p>An <loc href="#ActRelationship-cls">ActRelationship</loc> is an association between a pair of Acts.  This includes Act to Act associations such as collector/component, predecessor/successor, and cause/outcome.</p>
					<p>
The class has two associations to the Act class, one named "source" the other named "target". .... Since the relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of the source act object. That means that the originator of the information reported in an act object is not only responsible for the attribute values of that object, but also for all its outgoing relationships.</p>
					<p>
The rule of attribution is that all act relationships are attributed to the responsible actor of the Act at the source of the ActRelationship (the "source act".)
</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="RoleLinkDef">
					<head>RoleLink</head>
					<p>A <loc href="#RoleLink-cls">RoleLink</loc> is a connection between two roles expressing a dependency between those roles. </p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="subclasses">
					<head>Sub Classes of Act, Entity and Role</head>
					<p>Entity, Act and Role are "high-level" classes, although they are not "abstract" classes in the formal sense (i.e. meaningful instances of both classes are quite common).  As a result, it has been necessary to define a number of more specialized subclasses of these three classes to specify the additional data (class attributes) required in more specific contexts (e.g. the Observation subclass of Act and the Living Subject and Material subclasses of Entity).  Attributes of a subclass must be both useful and unique to that subclass. Subclasses inherit all of the attributes of their parent superclass.</p>
					<p>There are meaningful subclasses in each of these hierarchies that do not require additional attributes, and therefore are not represented as classes in the RIM.  The "classCode" attribute in each of these hierarchies specifies which class is represented.  The code set that can be used with the "classCode" attributes are tightly controlled by HL7.  A second attribute in each hierarchy, the "code" attribute provides a further classification of subtypes of each subclass.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="RIM-Mood">
					<head>The Concept of Mood</head>
					<p>The Act class represents intentional actions. These actions can exist in different "moods".  Moods describe activities as they progress in the business cycle, from defined, through planned and ordered to complete. The mood of an Act is specified by the value of the Act.moodCode attribute.</p>
					<p>
Any instance of an Act assumes one and only one mood and will not change its mood along its life cycle. The moods - definition, intent, order, event - seem to specify a life cycle of an activity. However, the participants in the activity in these different moods are different, as is the data. Therefore, the mood of an Act instance is static. The progression actualization (i.e., the progression from defined, through planned and ordered, to being performed) is called the "business cycle" to distinguish it from the "life cycle" of a single act instance. Related Act instances that form such a "business cycle" are linked through the ActRelationship class.
</p>
				</div3>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="RIMDataTypes">
				<head>Data Type and Vocabulary Specifications</head>
				<p>The RIM class, attribute and association definitions provide detail about logical meaning, but a full specification requires data type and vocabulary specifications.  <emph role="strong">Data Types</emph> define the allowable values of attributes and what these values "mean."  Data types are therefore the fundamental building blocks that shape (and constrain) all the semantics that can ultimately expressed in the RIM. For HL7 Version 3, the datatype specifications are found in the <xspecref spec="datatypes.htm" alt="Data Types Abstract Specification"/> and in the <xspecref spec="datatypes-its-xml.htm" alt="V3 Data Types Implementable Technology Specification for XML"/>  A summary of the data types is also provided in Appendix B.</p>
				<p>Vocabulary specifications for attributes include the assignment of a default domain, and a "coding strength." <emph role="strong">Vocabulary Domains</emph> are explicitly defined in <xspecref spec="vocabulary.htm" alt="Vocabulary Domains"/>.  They document cross-reference and alternative representations among coding systems, while keeping track of the logical concepts being expressed by each code. Each coded attribute may only be expressed using specific Vocabulary Domains.</p>
				<p>
					<emph role="strong">Coding strength</emph> is a coded property of an attribute that states whether or not a user of the HL7 Version 3 standard may communicate a coded value that is not part of the defined domain.  Such a value is termed an "exception" to the domain.  Coding strength may have one of two values.  <emph role="strong">Coded with Exceptions (CWE) </emph> allows the end user to send a term from a local coding system in place of a term from the formal domain. <emph role="strong">Coded , No Exceptions (CNE) </emph> states that communication instances may only contain codes that are in the domain that constrains the attribute.</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="RIM-method">
				<head>HL7 Version 3 Methodology and the RIM</head>
				<p>In summary, the primary motivation for the development of the RIM was the desire to clearly define the various data elements and relationships that comprise the healthcare information space.  A direct outgrowth of this knowledge explication exercise is the ability to reuse the same concept in multiple healthcare messages.  The complete process of defining a message is defined and discussed in the V3 Guide and accompanying HL7 Message Definition Framework (MDF).  The basic steps include definition and documentation of the data interchange needs (e.g. a set of messages to support a particular clinical or administrative process) via a Storyboard, the selection/restriction of the RIM to those classes and attributes needed to populate the given message, and the subsequent application of additional constraints on number and possible values of each attribute. </p>

								<xdtref ref="dt-ANY">ANY</xdtref>
								<!-- dtRef ref="dt-ANY">ANY</dtRef -->
							</td>
							<td>
Defines the basic properties of every data value. This is an abstract
type, meaning that no value can be just a data value without belonging
to any concrete type. Every concrete type is a specialization of this
general abstract DataValue type.

						<tr>
							<td>Boolean</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-BL">BL</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
The Boolean type stands for the values of two-valued logic. A Boolean
value can be either <emph>true</emph> or <emph>false</emph>, or, as
any other value may be NULL.
    </td>

						<tr>
							<td>Encapsulated Data</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-ED">ED</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
Data that is primarily intended for human interpretation or for
further machine processing outside the scope of HL7. This includes
unformatted or formatted written language, multimedia data, or
structured information in as defined by a different standard (e.g.,
XML-signatures.)  Instead of the data itself, an <xdtref ref="dt-ED">ED</xdtref>
may contain only a reference (see <xdtref ref="dt-TEL">TEL</xdtref>.) Note that
the <xdtref ref="dt-ST">ST</xdtref> data type is a specialization of the
<xdtref ref="dt-ED">ED</xdtref> data type when the <xdtref ref="dt-ED">ED</xdtref> media
type is text/plain.
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Character String</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-ST">ST</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
The character string data type stands for text data, primarily
intended for machine processing (e.g., sorting, querying, indexing,
etc.) Used for names, symbols, and formal expressions.
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Concept Descriptor</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-CD">CD</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
A concept descriptor represents any kind of concept usually by
giving a code defined in a code system. 

A concept descriptor can contain the original text or phrase that
served as the basis of the coding and one or more translations into
different coding systems.

A concept descriptor can also contain qualifiers to describe, e.g., the
concept of a "left foot" as a postcoordinated term built from the
primary code "FOOT" and the qualifier "LEFT".

In exceptional cases, the concept descriptor need not contain a code
but only the original text describing that concept.
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Coded Simple Value</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-CS">CS</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
Coded data in its simplest form, where only the code and display name
is not predetermined. The code system and code system version is fixed
by the context in which the CS value occurs. CS is used for coded
attributes that have a single HL7-defined value set.
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Coded With Equivalents</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-CE">CE</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
Coded data that consists of a coded value (CV) and, optionally, coded
value(s) from other coding systems that identify the same
concept. Used when alternative codes may exist.
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Character String with Code</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-SC">SC</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
A <xdtref ref="dt-ST">Character String</xdtref> that optionally may have a
code attached. The text must always be present if a code is present.
The code is often a local code. 
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Instance Identifier</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-II">II</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
An identifier that uniquely identifies a thing or object. Examples
are object identifier for HL7 RIM objects, medical record number,
order id, service catalog item id, Vehicle Identification Number
(VIN), etc. Instance identifiers are defined based on ISO object
identifiers.

						<tr>
							<td>Telecommunication Address</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-TEL">TEL</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
A telephone number (voice or fax), e-mail address, or other locator
for a resource mediated by telecommunication equipment. The address is
specified as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) qualified by time
specification and use codes that help deciding which address to use
for a given time and purpose.

							</td>
							<td>
A name for a person, organization, place or thing. A sequence of name
parts, such as first name or family name, prefix, suffix, etc.
Examples for entity name values are "Jim Bob Walton, Jr.", "Health
Level Seven, Inc.", "Lake Tahoe", etc. An entity name may be as simple
as a character string or may consist of several entity name parts,
such as, "Jim", "Bob", "Walton", and "Jr.", "Health Level Seven" and
"Inc.", "Lake" and "Tahoe".
    </td>

    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Integer Number</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-INT">INT</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
Integer numbers (-1,0,1,2, 100, 3398129, etc.) are precise numbers
that are results of counting and enumerating. Integer numbers are
discrete, the set of integers is infinite but countable.  No arbitrary
limit is imposed on the range of integer numbers. Two NULL flavors are
defined for the positive and negative infinity.
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Real Number</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-REAL">REAL</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
Fractional numbers. Typically used whenever quantities are measured,
estimated, or computed from other real numbers.  The typical
representation is decimal, where the number of significant decimal
digits is known as the precision.
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Ratio</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-RTO">RTO</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
A quantity constructed as the quotient of a numerator quantity divided
by a denominator quantity. Common factors in the numerator and
denominator are not automatically cancelled out.  The <emph>RTO</emph> data
type supports titers (e.g., "1:128") and other quantities produced by
laboratories that truly represent ratios. Ratios are not simply
"structured numerics", particularly blood pressure measurements
(e.g. "120/60") are not ratios. In many cases the <xdtref ref="dt-REAL">REAL</xdtref>
should be used instead of the <emph>RTO</emph>.
    </td>

						<tr>
							<td>Physical Quantity</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-PQ">PQ</xdtref>

						<tr>
							<td>Monetary Amount</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-MO">MO</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
A monetary amount is a quantity expressing the amount of money in some
currency. Currencies are the units in which monetary amounts are
denominated in different economic regions. While the monetary amount
is a single kind of quantity (money) the exchange rates between the
different units are variable.  This is the principal difference
between physical quantity and monetary amounts, and the reason why
currency units are not physical units.

						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Point in Time</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-TS">TS</xdtref>

							<td>History</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-HIST">HIST</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
A set of data values that conform to the history item (HXIT) type,
(i.e., that have a valid-time property). The history information is
not limited to the past; expected future values can also appear.
      </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Uncertain Value - Probabilistic</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-UVP">UVP</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
A generic data type extension used to specify a probability expressing
the information producer's belief that the given value holds.
    </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Parametric Probability Distribution</td>
							<td>
								<xdtref ref="dt-PPD">PPD</xdtref>
							</td>
							<td>
A generic data type extension specifying uncertainty of quantitative
data using a distribution function and its parameters. Aside from the 
specific parameters of the distribution, a mean (expected value) and 
standard deviation is always given to help maintain a minimum layer
of interoperability if receiving applications cannot deal with a
certain probability distribution.

							<td>
A set of points in time, specifying the timing of events and actions
and the cyclical validity-patterns that may exist for certain kinds of
information, such as phone numbers (evening, daytime), addresses (so
called "snowbirds," residing in the south during winter and north
during summer) and office hours.
