				<head>What is the CDA</head>
				<p>The HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is a document markup standard that specifies the structure and semantics of "clinical documents" for the purpose of exchange. A clinical document is a documentation of clinical observations and services, with the following characteristics:				<list role="unordered">
						<item>Persistence – A clinical document continues to exist in an unaltered state, for a time period defined by local and regulatory requirements (<emph role="strong">NOTE:</emph> There is a distinct scope of persistence for a clinical document, independent of the persistence of any XML-encoded CDA document instance).

					</item>
						<item>Stewardship – A clinical document is maintained by an organization entrusted with its care.</item>
						<item>Potential for authentication - A clinical document is an assemblage of information that is intended to be legally authenticated.</item>
						<item>Context - A clinical document establishes the default context for its contents.</item>
						<item>Wholeness - Authentication of a clinical document applies to the whole and does not apply to portions of the document without the full context of the document.</item>
						<item>Human readability – A clinical document is human readable.</item>
					</list>
				</p>
				<p>A CDA document is a defined and complete information object that can include text, images, sounds, and other multimedia content.</p>
				<div3 id="Key_aspects_of_the_CDA">
					<head>Key aspects of the CDA</head>
					<p>Key aspects of the CDA include:

					<list role="unordered">
							<item>CDA documents are encoded in Extensible Markup Language (XML). (<emph role="strong">NOTE:</emph> When alternate implementations are feasible, suitable conformance requirements will be issued so that in future the syntax may not be limited to XML.)</item>
							<item>CDA documents derive their machine processable meaning from the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) and use the HL7 Version 3 Data Types.</item>
							<item>The CDA specification is richly expressive and flexible. Document-level, section-level and entry-level templates can be used to constrain the generic CDA specification (see <specref ref="The_A_in_CDA"/>).</item>
						</list>
					</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="Scope_of_the_CDA">
					<head>Scope of the CDA</head>
					<p>The scope of the CDA is the standardization of clinical documents for exchange. </p>
					<p>The data format of clinical documents outside of the exchange context (e.g., the data format used to store clinical documents) is not addressed in this specification.</p>
					<p>CDA documents can be transmitted in HL7 messages designed to transfer clinical documents. While the detailed specification for such messages is outside of the scope of the CDA, this specification does impose requirements upon the packaging of CDA documents in HL7 messages (see <specref ref="CDA_Document_Exchange_in_HL7_Messages"/>).</p>
					<p>The CDA does not specify the creation or management of documents, only their exchange markup. While it may be possible to directly use the CDA Schema in a document authoring environment, such use is not the primary purpose of the CDA specification. </p>
					<p>Document management is critically interdependent with the CDA specifications, but the specification of document management messages is outside the scope of the CDA. (For more on this, see <specref ref="Relationship_of_the_CDA_to_HL7_Messaging_Standards"/>).</p>
					<note>
						<p>Several committees are developing structured document specifications that overlap in part with the CDA specification. The Structured Documents Technical Committee, in collaboration with Publishing and these other committees, is developing a Structured Documents Infrastructure chapter to clarify these relationships which should be available 
						in upcoming editions.</p>
					</note>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="Goals_and_Design_Principles">
					<head>Goals and Design Principles</head>
					<p>The goals of the CDA are:

					<list role="unordered">
							<item>Give priority to delivery of patient care.</item>
							<item>Allow cost effective implementation across as wide a spectrum of systems as possible.</item>
							<item>Support exchange of human-readable documents between users, including those with different levels of technical sophistication.</item>
							<item>Promote longevity of all information encoded according to this architecture.</item>
							<item>Enable a wide range of post-exchange processing applications.</item>
							<item>Be compatible with a wide range of document creation applications.</item>
							<item>Promote exchange that is independent of the underlying transfer or storage mechanism.</item>
							<item>Prepare the design reasonably quickly.</item>
							<item>Enable policy-makers to control their own information requirements without extension to this specification.</item>
						</list>
					</p>
					<p>A number of design principles follow from consideration of the above goals:

						<list role="unordered">
							<item>This architecture must be compatible with XML and the HL7 RIM.</item>
							<item>This architecture must be compatible with representations of clinical information arising from other HL7 committees.</item>
							<item>Technical barriers to use of the architecture should be minimized.</item>
							<item>The architecture specifies the representation of instances required for exchange.</item>
							<item>The architecture should impose minimal constraints or requirements on document structure and content required for exchange.</item>
							<item>The architecture must be scalable to accommodate fine-grained markup such as highly structured text and coded data.</item>
							<item>Document specifications based on this architecture should accommodate such constraints and requirements as supplied by appropriate professional, commercial, and regulatory agencies.</item>
							<item>Document specifications for document creation and processing, if intended for exchange, should map to this exchange architecture. </item>
							<item>CDA documents must be human readable using widely-available and commonly-deployed XML-aware browsers and print drivers and a generic CDA style sheet written in a standard style sheet language.</item>
							<item>Use open standards.</item>

				<head>General CDA Concepts</head>
				<div3 id="Major_Components_of_a_CDA_Document">
					<head>Major Components of a CDA Document</head>
					<p>This section serves as a high-level introduction to the major components of a CDA document, all of which are described again and in greater detail later on. The intent here is to familiarize the reader with the high-level concepts to facilitate an understanding of the sections that follow. </p>
					<p>Major components of a prototypic CDA document are shown in the following skeletal example. (Note that many required components are missing to simplify the example. See <specref ref="Samples"/> for a detailed conformant example).</p>
					<p>A CDA document is wrapped by the &lt;ClinicalDocument&gt; element, and contains a header (see <specref ref="CDA_Header"/>) and a body (see <specref ref="CDA_Body"/>). The header lies between the &lt;ClinicalDocument&gt; and the &lt;structuredBody&gt; elements, and identifies and classifies the document and provides information on authentication, the encounter, the patient, and the involved providers. </p>
					<p>The body contains the clinical report, and can be either an unstructured blob, or can be comprised of structured markup. The example shows a structured body, which is wrapped by the &lt;structuredBody&gt; element, and which is divided up into recursively nestable document sections.</p>
					<p>A CDA document section is wrapped by the &lt;section&gt; element. Each section can contain a single narrative block (see <specref ref="CDA_Section_Narrative_Block"/>), and any number of CDA entries (see <specref ref="CDA_Entry_Acts"/>) and external references.</p>
					<p>The CDA narrative block is wrapped by the &lt;text&gt; element within the &lt;section&gt; element, and must contain the human readable content to be rendered. See also <specref ref="Human_Readability_and_Rendering_CDA_Documents"/> and <specref ref="CDA_Conformance"/> for principles governing the representation of the narrative block, and conformance requirements on the part of originators when populating the block, and recipients when rendering it.</p>
					<p>Within a document section, the narrative block represents content to be rendered, whereas CDA entries represent structured content provided for further computer processing (e.g. decision support applications). CDA entries typically encode content present in the narrative block of the same section. The example shows two &lt;observation&gt; CDA entries, and a &lt;substanceAdministration&gt; entry containing a nested &lt;supply&gt; entry, although several other CDA entries are defined. </p>
					<p>CDA entries can nest and they can reference external objects. CDA external references always occur within the context of a CDA entry. External references refer to content that exists outside this CDA document - such as some other image, some other procedure, or some other observation (which is wrapped by the &lt;externalObservation&gt; element). Externally referenced material is not covered by the authentication of the document referencing it.</p>

				<div3 id="The_A_in_CDA">
					<head>The "A" in "CDA"</head>
					<p>The notion of CDA "levels" in CDA, Release One anticipated a hierarchical set of XML DTDs or XML Schemas to achieve the goals enumerated above (see <specref ref="Goals_and_Design_Principles"/>). This hierarchy formed an "architecture", hence the "A" in "CDA". </p>
					<p>While the notion of levels in CDA, Release Two remains constant, the approach to representing the hierarchies has changed. The current specification consists of a single CDA XML Schema, and the architecture arises from the ability to apply one or more of a hierarchical set of HL7 Templates, which serve to constrain the richness and flexibility of CDA.</p>
					<note>
						<p>The CDA can be constrained by mechanisms defined in <xspecref spec="conformance" alt="HL7 V3 Refinement and Localization"/>. HL7 technical formalisms (e.g. HL7 Template specifications, HL7 Model Interchange Format) to constrain CDA are still in development at the time of writing this standard.<br/>
							<br/>

						The RIM's <xspecref spec="rim" ref="InfrastructureRoot-cls" alt="InfrastructureRoot class"/> contains an attribute, templateId, which is available for use in CDA. Thus, while HL7 Templates are in flux at this time, CDA provides a mechanism to reference a template or implementation guide that has been assigned a unique identifier. Until there is a formal HL7 Template specification, there is no standardized process to test conformance against referenced templates.<br/>
							<br/>

						There is no requirement that CDA must be constrained. Implementations that use structured data elements to drive automated processes will typically require that they be either: (1) constrained by an appropriately refined model or other HL7 approved constraint language; or (2) comply with a detailed implementation guide that details the manner in which structured elements are to be represented and their intended interpretation to a level sufficient to ensure a degree of clinical safety that is appropriate to the use case that it is designed to address.</p>
					</note>
					<p>There are many kinds of HL7 Templates that might be created. Among them, two are particularly relevant for clinical documents: (1) those that constrain the document sections based on the type of document (section-level templates); (2) those that constrain the entries within document sections (entry-level templates). In fact, a comparison can be made between the prior notion of CDA levels and the current notion of CDA with these two kinds of HL7 Templates:</p>

				<div3 id="Human_Readability_and_Rendering_CDA_Documents">
					<head>Human Readability and Rendering CDA Documents</head>
					<p>The CDA requirement for human readability guarantees that a receiver of a CDA document can algorithmically display the clinical content of the note on a standard Web browser. CDA, Release Two, with its blend of narrative and CDA entries, presents new challenges to this requirement. </p>
					<p>Among the requirements affecting the design of CDA Release 2 are the following:</p>
					<p>
						<list role="unordered">
							<item>There must be a deterministic way for a recipient of an arbitrary CDA document to render the attested content.</item>
							<item>Human readability shall not require a sender to transmit a special style sheet along with a CDA document. It must be possible to render all CDA documents with a single style sheet and general-market display tools.</item>
							<item>Human readability applies to the authenticated content. There may be additional information conveyed in the document that is there primarily for machine processing that is not authenticated and need not be rendered.</item>
							<item>When structured content is derived from narrative, there must be a mechanism to describe the process (e.g. by author, by human coder, by natural language processing algorithm, by specific software) by which machine-processable portions were derived from a block of narrative.</item>
							<item>When narrative is derived from structured content, there must be a mechanism to identify the process by which narrative was generated from structured data.</item>
						</list>
					</p>
					<p>These principles and requirements have led to the current approach, where the material to be rendered is placed into the Section.text field (see <specref ref="CDA_Section_Narrative_Block"/>). The content model of this field is specially hand crafted to meet the above requirements, and corresponds closely to the content model of sections in CDA, Release One. Structured observations can reference narrative content in the Section.text field. Multimedia observations are encoded outside the Section.text field, and the &lt;renderMultiMedia&gt; tag within the Section.text field provides an outgoing pointer that indicates where the referenced multimedia should be rendered.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="XML_Markup_of_CDA_Documents">
					<head>XML Markup of CDA Documents</head>
					<p>XML markup of CDA documents is prescribed in this specification. CDA instances are valid against the CDA Schema and may be subject to additional validation (see <specref ref="CDA_Conformance"/>). There is no prohibition against multiple schema languages (e.g., W3C, DTD, RELAXNG), as long as conforming instances are compatible. </p>
					<p>Design Principles of the CDA Schema include:


					<list role="unordered">
							<item>
								<emph role="strong">General Requirements: </emph>The design of the CDA Schema follows the more general requirements for CDA (see <specref ref="Goals_and_Design_Principles"/>).</item>
							<item>
								<emph role="strong">CDA Schema and V3 Implementation Technology Specification (ITS) : </emph>The CDA Schema will follow the general V3 XML ITS.</item>
							<item>
								<emph role="strong">RIM Mapping: </emph>

The CDA Schema describes the style of XML markup of CDA instances for the purpose of exchange. It cannot be understood outside the context of this defining specification. At the same time, the CDA Schema is useful on its own for implementation purposes even though it is not intended to replicate or take the place of the R-MIM and HD. The CDA Schema, then, is not, in and of itself, an adequate map between conforming instance and the HL7 RIM. Semantic interoperability of CDA instances requires use and knowledge of the CDA Schema, R-MIM and HD as well as the corresponding RIM.

</item>
							<item>
								<emph role="strong">Document Analysis: </emph>The CDA Schema and conformant instances should adhere to the requirements of document analysis in derivation of the content model.

								

									<p>
									<emph role="strong">NOTE: </emph>Document analysis is a process that might be thought of as the document equivalent of a use case. Document analysis looks at a single instance or class of documents and analyzes their structure and content, often representing this as a tree structure "elm" notation. Document analysis also looks at the business rules for the lifecycle of that document or document class. Traditionally, document analysis determines the content model and overall structure and style of XML. <br/>
									<br/>Document analysis is an iterative step in content model derivation -- the "bottom up" approach to complement the "top down" derivation from the RIM. This will ensure that schemas and instances are not only RIM-derived, but represent recognizable artifacts in a simple manner.</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<emph role="strong">Forward and Backward Compatibility: </emph>The CDA Schema should adhere to the requirements for forward and backward compatibility. (See <specref ref="Backwards_and_Forwards_Compatibility"/>)</item>
							<item>
								<emph role="strong">Naming: </emph>While XML markup, by definition, is for machine processing, it should be optimized for human review, debug, and design. The CDA Schema is not "self-documenting", but meaning should be clear from tag name and documentation (e.g., mapping to RIM). The human-language sense of a tag name should not be counterintuitive.</item>
							<item>
								<emph role="strong">Vocabulary:</emph> Vocabulary can be enumerated within the CDA Schema or in an external, referenced source. It is preferable to enumerate it when the vocabulary terms are both limited (not too large in number) and stable (not subject to change between ballot cycles).  Where vocabulary is either too large or is subject to change, it is preferable to maintain it external to the CDA Schema and incorporate it by reference. In these cases, XML schema validation will not suffice for conformance.</item>
						</list>
					</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="Security_Confidentiality_and_Data_Integrity">
					<head>Security, Confidentiality, and Data Integrity</head>
					<p>Application systems sending and receiving CDA documents are responsible for meeting all legal requirements for document authentication, confidentiality, and retention. For communications over public media, cryptographic techniques for source/recipient authentication and secure transport of encapsulated documents may be required, and should be addressed with commercially available tools outside the scope of this standard. </p>
					<p>The CDA does provide confidentiality status information to aid application systems in managing access to sensitive data.  Confidentiality status may apply to the entire document or to specified segments of the document.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="Relationship_of_the_CDA_to_HL7_Messaging_Standards">
					<head>Relationship of the CDA to HL7 Messaging Standards</head>
					<p>A CDA document is a defined and complete information object that can exist outside of a messaging context and/or can be a payload within an HL7 message (see <specref ref="CDA_Document_Exchange_in_HL7_Messages"/>). Thus, the CDA complements HL7 messaging specifications.</p>
					<p>Clinical documents can be revised, and they can be appended to existing documents. Ideally, an updated document would declare itself as obsolete, and would contain an explicit pointer to a more recent version. This would lessen the chances of a healthcare provider basing treatment decisions on erroneous or incomplete data. </p>
					<p>In practice, however, it is impossible to guarantee an explicit forward pointer from an outdated version to the newer version. Without a process that tracks the chain of custody of clinical documents and all of their copies, there can be no way to guarantee that a clinical document being viewed has not been subsequently revised. </p>
					<p>To minimize the risk of viewing superseded information, there is a critical interdependence between clinical documents and document management systems. If CDA documents are viewed outside the context of a document management system, it cannot be known with certainty whether or not the viewed document has been revised. HL7 messages that carry CDA documents (such as the MDM messages in HL7 V2.x and the <ilxspecref spec="&mr;">HL7 V3 Medical Records messages</ilxspecref>) convey critical contextual information that ensures accurate viewing of clinical data.</p>

				<head>CDA Conformance</head>
				<note>
					<p>

					See <xspecref spec="conformance" alt="HL7 V3 Refinement and Localization"/> for a complete discussion of V3 conformance. </p>
				</note>
				<p>A conformant CDA document is one that at a minimum validates against the CDA Schema, and that restricts its use of coded vocabulary to values allowable within the specified vocabulary domains. However a computer cannot validate every aspect of conformance. The focus of this section is to highlight these aspects of CDA that cannot be machine validated - particularly those aspects related to the CDA human readability requirements.</p>
				<p>A document originator is an application role that creates a CDA document. CDA documents can be created via transformation from some other format, as a direct output of an authoring application, etc. The document originator often is responsible for communicating with a persistent storage location, often using HL7 V2 MDM or <ilxspecref spec="&mr;">HL7 V3 Medical Records messages</ilxspecref>.  The document originator is responsible for ensuring that generated CDA documents are fully conformant to this specification.</p>
				<p>A document recipient is an application role that receives status updates and documents from a document originator or document management system. The document recipient is responsible for ensuring that received CDA documents are rendered in accordance to this specification.</p>
				<p>Because CDA is an exchange standard and may not represent the original form of a document, there are no persistent storage requirements for CDA documents defined in this standard. However, as noted above (see <specref ref="Relationship_of_the_CDA_to_HL7_Messaging_Standards"/>), document management is critically interdependent with the CDA specification. The custodian identified in the CDA header (see <specref ref="custodian"/>) is the participant charged with maintaining the original document, which may be in some form other than CDA.</p>

				</note>
				<p>Locally-defined markup may be used when local semantics have no corresponding representation in the CDA specification. CDA seeks to standardize the highest level of shared meaning while providing a clean and standard mechanism for tagging meaning that is not shared. In order to support local extensibility requirements, it is permitted to include additional XML elements and attributes that are not included in the CDA schema.  These extensions should not change the meaning of any of the standard data items, and receivers must be able to safely ignore these elements. Document recipients must be able to faithfully render the CDA document while ignoring extensions.

				<p>Extensions may be included in the instance in a namespace other than the HL7v3 namespace, but must not be included within an element of type ED (e.g., &lt;text&gt; within &lt;procedure&gt;) since the contents of an ED datatype within the conformant document may be in a different namespace. Since all conformant content (outside of elements of type ED) is in the HL7 namespace, the sender can put any extension content into a foreign namespace (any namespace other than the HL7 namespace).  Receiving systems must not report an error if such extensions are present.</p>
				<p>When these extension mechanisms mark up content of general relevance, HL7 encourages users to get their requirements formalized in a subsequent version of the standard so as to maximize the use of shared semantics.

				<head>Backwards and Forwards Compatibility</head>
				<note>
					<p>A detailed list of all changes between CDA, Release One and CDA, Release Two can be found in the appendix (see <specref ref="Enumeration_of_Changes_Between_Release_One_and_Release_Two"/>). </p>
				</note>
				<p>The basic model of CDA, Release Two is essentially unchanged. A CDA document has a header and a body. The body contains nested sections. These sections can be coded using standard vocabularies, and can contain CDA entries. The main evolutionary steps in CDA, Release Two are that both header and body are fully RIM-derived, and there is a much richer assortment of entries to use within CDA sections. CDA, Release Two enables clinical content to be formally expressed to the extent that it is modeled in the RIM.</p>
				<p>This section describes the types of changes that can be introduced to a new release of CDA and CDA principles of forward and backward compatibility. In general, changes can include the addition of new components; a renaming of components (including XML element and attribute names in the CDA Schema); a deprecation of components defined in a prior release; a change in cardinality of a component (either to tighten or to loosen); or a change in a vocabulary domain of a component (to add or change values, to change between CWE and CNE). The following set of guiding principles defines how CDA can continue to evolve, while protecting the investment implementers have made through their adoption of earlier releases.

				<list role="unordered">
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Documentation</emph> : A new release of CDA will enumerate all substantive changes from the previous release.

</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Attested content</emph>: Attested, human readable content must be completely loss-less across CDA releases. Backwards and forwards compatibility on the attested content will be supported such that it will be possible for an automated transformation script to translate the human readable content in both directions. </item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">New components</emph> : A new release of CDA can introduce new components. To preserve roundtrip translation capability, a translation from the new release to a prior release must represent the new components as extensions (e.g. local markup or local namespace).</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Renaming </emph> : A new release of CDA can rename components (including XML element and attribute names). Where this occurs, a mapping table will list all changes. Renaming will adhere to the naming convention articulated above (see <specref ref="XML_Markup_of_CDA_Documents"/>).</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Deprecated components</emph> : A new release of CDA can deprecate components defined in a prior release. Deprecated components will be removed from the subsequent release of the standard, and therefore their use is not recommended. </item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Cardinality</emph> : A new release of CDA can change the cardinality of a component. Where an optional component becomes required, a translation between releases requires a dummy value or a null value.</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Changes to vocabulary domain</emph> : A new release of CDA can change the vocabulary domain of a component. Where this occurs, a mapping table will list changes. </item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Change within CNE</emph> : Where a value in a CNE domain in a prior release is no longer present or has been renamed, a mapping table will indicate what the current value should be.</item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Change within CWE</emph> :  When a CWE domain is expanded, users should begin using the new codes in addition to any equivalent local codes they may already be using. </item>
						<item>
							<emph role="strong">Change from CWE to CNE</emph> : To preserve roundtrip translation capability, a translation between releases must represent unrecognized components as extensions (e.g. local markup or local namespace). Ideally these situations will surface during a ballot cycle, allowing the CNE domain to be sufficiently inclusive. </item>
					</list>
				</p>
				<p>These guiding principles have lead to the current approach, defined in this Release Two of the CDA standard. The goal is to ensure that the documents created using Release One can be transformed into minimally compliant Release Two instances and that Release Two documents received can be down-translated to Release One instances using automated means (transformations) with no loss of attested, human-readable content and known limitation on loss of universal processing semantics.</p>

			<head>Introduction to CDA Technical Artifacts</head>
			<p>A complete understanding of CDA requires an understanding of the normative artifacts used to define the specification. <emph role="strong">The CDA Hierarchical Description is the definitive source for CDA conformance rules</emph>, and serves as the source from which the CDA Schema is derived. While a CDA instance must validate against the CDA Schema, it must also adhere to the conformance rules stated in the CDA Hierarchical Description. The CDA Hierarchical Description is derived from the CDA R-MIM, which in turn is derived from the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM). The HL7 RIM is the definitive source for class and attribute definitions. </p>
			<p>The following sections summarize the artifacts used by CDA, and how they can be used by those seeking to implement or understand the CDA specification.</p>
			<div2 id="HL7_Reference_Information_Model">
				<head>HL7 Reference Information Model</head>
				<p>The definitive description of the HL7 Reference Information Model can be found <xspecref spec="rim" alt="here"/>.</p>
				<p>The HL7 RIM is the definitive reference source for class and attribute definitions. The CDA specification does not exhaustively replicate RIM definitions, but instead refers the reader to the RIM for complete definitions. While CDA may further constrain RIM definitions, at no time will CDA definitions conflict with those in the RIM.</p>
				<p>CDA, Release Two is derived from HL7 RIM, Version 2.07. </p>
				<p>Where a reader needs to see the complete definition of a RIM attribute or class, they should refer to the HL7 RIM. 

</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="HL7_V3_Data_Types">
				<head>HL7 V3 Data Types</head>
				<p>HL7 defines both an <xspecref spec="datatypes" alt="abstract data type specification"/>, which is the definitive reference, and an <xspecref spec="datatypes-its-xml" alt="XML-specific data type representation"/>. 

</p>
				<p>Data types define the structural format of the data carried within a RIM attribute and influence the set of allowable values an attribute may assume. Some data types have very little intrinsic semantic content. However HL7 also defines more extensive data types such as the one for an entity's name. Every attribute in the RIM is associated with one and only one data type.</p>
				<p>CDA, Release Two uses the HL7 V3 Data Types, Release One abstract and XML-specific specification. 

</p>
				<p>A reader will often find that the XML-specific description of a data type is sufficient for implementation, but at times will want to refer to the abstract data type specification for a more comprehensive discussion.</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="HL7_Vocabulary_Domains">
				<head>HL7 Vocabulary Domains</head>
				<p>The definitive description of HL7 V3 Vocabulary Domains can be found <xspecref spec="vocabulary" alt="here"/>.</p>
				<p>Vocabulary domains represent value sets for coded CDA components. These domains can include HL7-defined concepts or can be drawn from HL7-recognized coding systems such as LOINC or SNOMED. The HL7 Vocabulary chapter is the definitive reference source for the definitions of HL7-defined concepts. While CDA may further constrain these definitions, at no time will CDA definitions conflict with those in the Vocabulary chapter.</p>
				<p>Vocabulary domains have a coding strength that can be "Coded, No Extensions" (CNE), in which case the only allowable values for the CDA component are those in stated value set; or "Coded, With Extensions" (CWE), in which case values outside the stated value set can be used if necessary. Every vocabulary domain has a unique HL7-assigned identifier, and every concept within a vocabulary domain has a unique code. </p>
				<p>Where a coded CDA component is associated with a CNE value set, the allowable values are fixed by the standard, and are enumerated as shown in the following example:</p>
				<table>
					<caption>Value set for relatedDocument.typeCode (CNE)</caption>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Code </th>
							<th>Definition</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>APND (append)</p>

							<p>The current document is an addendum to the ParentDocument.</p>

							<p>The current document is a replacement of the ParentDocument.</p>

							<p>XFRM (transform)</p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>The current document is a transformation of the ParentDocument.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p/>
				<p>A number of vocabulary domains and coding systems already in existence (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED) may be used to encode concepts in CDA documents (e.g., Section.code, Observation.code). These domains are referenced as external domains according to HL7 V3 processes. Where a coded CDA component is associated with a CWE vocabulary domain, a preferred value set may be specified by the standard (such as for ClinicalDocument.code or for ClinicalDocument.confidentialityCode). Where the standard does not enumerate any values, the implementor is free to choose from any external source, such as LOINC or SNOMED or some other realm-specific vocabulary.</p>
				<p>Where a reader needs to see the complete definition of an HL7-defined value, they should refer to the HL7 Vocabulary chapter. </p>

			<div2 id="HL7_CDA_RMIM">
				<head>HL7 CDA R-MIM</head>
				<p>The definitive description of the HL7 V3 model refinement process, R-MIM development and interpretation can be found <xspecref spec="v3guide" ref="v3dmim" alt="here"/>.</p>
				<p>The CDA R-MIM is described below (see <specref ref="CDA_RMIM"/>).</p>
				<p>

HL7 specifications derived from the HL7 RIM use a process known as "cloning" to refine domain specific models from the base HL7 RIM. When a refined model makes use of a specialization of an HL7 RIM class, the new class in the refined model is known as a clone of the HL7 RIM class. These specializations may further constrain the base class, for example, by specifying more restrictive attribute cardinality or by further constraints on the allowed vocabulary values. Multiple clones of a particular HL7 RIM class may appear in a refined model, each representing a different specialization.</p>
				<p>The CDA R-MIM is a graphical representation of the CDA specification. It is presented using diagramming conventions and notations that were developed by HL7 to represent the specific semantic constructs contained in the critical, "back-bone" classes of the RIM. Although it could be represented in UML notation, as the RIM is, the HL7 notation provides more details about the specific constraints and class clones being represented. The HL7 diagramming convention abbreviates some relationship conventions, enabling diagrams to be smaller and more concise and to convey more information visually. </p>
				<p>The CDA R-MIM is a graphical aid to understanding the specification. Because the CDA Hierarchical Description, and subsequently the CDA Schema, are derived from the R-MIM, the R-MIM serves as a good basis for describing the standard. The narrative description of the specific clones used by CDA is organized to correspond with the R-MIM. </p>

			<div2 id="HL7_CDA_Hierarchical_Description">
				<head>HL7 CDA Hierarchical Description</head>
				<p>The definitive description of developing and interpreting HL7 Hierarchical Descriptions can be found <xspecref spec="v3guide" ref="v3ghmd" alt="here"/>.</p>
				<p>The CDA HD is described below (see <specref ref="CDA_Hierarchical_Description"/>).</p>
				<p>A Hierarchical Description is a tabular representation of the sequence of elements (i.e., classes, attributes and associations) represented in an R-MIM and that define the structure of the instance without reference to XML or any other implementation technology. </p>
				<p>The CDA HD is the definitive source for CDA conformance rules, and serves as the source from which the CDA Schema is derived. While a CDA instance must validate against the CDA Schema, it must also adhere to the conformance rules stated in the CDA Hierarchical Description. For CDA, Release Two, the CDA HD is uniquely identified by the string "POCD_HD000040". As described below (see <specref ref="Clinical_Document"/>), this value must be included in a CDA instance to serve as an unambiguous reference to the CDA, Release Two specification. 

</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="HL7_CDA_Schema">
				<head>HL7 CDA XML Implementation</head>
				<p>The CDA Schema is derived through the use of the HL7 XML Implementation Technology Specification (ITS). The definitive description of HL7 XML ITS and the process used to go from Hierarchical Description to Schema can be found <xspecref spec="messaging-its-xml" alt="here"/>.

</p>
				<p>The CDA Schema is described below (see <specref ref="CDA_Schema"/>).</p>
				<p>CDA, Release Two is based on the HL7 V3 XML Implementable Technology Specification for V3 Structures, Release One.</p>
				<p>Specific enhancements to the CDA Schema, above and beyond those defined in the HL7 V3 XML ITS, are described below in <specref ref="CDA_Schema"/>.</p>
				<p>Looking at the CDA R-MIM, a reader familiar with the RIM, the HL7 Development Framework and its rules for XML implementations, can identify the corresponding XML elements and attributes. Due to algorithmic generation of some of the element names, the correspondence may be unclear, and the reader should refer to the HL7 V3 XML ITS for more details. </p>

		<div1 id="CDA_Document_Exchange_in_HL7_Messages" ballotStatus="NormativeStandard">
			<head>CDA Document Exchange in HL7 Messages</head>
			<note>
				<p>The exact method by which a CDA instance is packaged and exchanged is outside the scope of this standard. While the MIME packaging method described here is not normative, it does illustrate one mechanism that meets the document exchange requirements described below.

</p>
			</note>
			<p>Any CDA exchange strategy must accommodate the following requirements:

					<list role="unordered">
					<item>All components of a CDA document that are integral to its state of wholeness (such as attested multimedia) are able to be included in a single exchange package.</item>
					<item>Content needing to be rendered if exchanging across a firewall where the links won't be traversable, must be able to be included in a single exchange package.</item>
					<item>Additional files associated with a CDA document to provide the recipient with the sender's rendering suggestions (such as one or more style sheets) are able to be included in a single exchange package.</item>
					<item>There is no need to change any of the references (e.g., a reference to attested multimedia in a separate file) within the base CDA document when creating the exchange package.</item>
					<item>There is no need to change any of the references (e.g., a reference to attested multimedia in a separate file) within the base CDA document when extracting the contents of an exchange package.</item>
					<item>There is no need to change any values of attributes of type XML ID when creating the exchange package.</item>
					<item>There are no restrictions on the directory structure used by receivers. Receivers can place the components of the CDA document into directories of their choosing.</item>
					<item>Critical metadata about the CDA instance needed for document management (e.g. document state, document archival status) must be included in the exchange package. (For a complete discussion of clinical document metadata, document management, and HL7 V3 document states and state transitions, refer to the <ilxspecref spec="&mr;">HL7 V3 Medical Records specification</ilxspecref>).



</item>
				</list>
			</p>
			<p>From the perspective of a V2.x or V3 message, a CDA document can be thought of as a multimedia object that can be exchanged as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME, RFC 2046) package, encoded as an encapsulated data type (ED). 



</p>
			<p>The current MIME recommendation is to follow the approach described in the Internet standard RFC 2557 <loc href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2557.txt" target="_blank">"MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)"</loc>, which is the approach for the MIME encapsulations of aggregate documents used by ebXML and DICOM. 






</p>
			<p>In V2.x, CDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment, in any message that can exchange documents (such as MDM). Within the OBX segment, the MIME package is placed in OBX.5 (Field 00573 Observation value), encoded as a V2.x encapsulated data type. The value of OBX.2 (Field 00570 Value Type) should be set to "ED". The value of OBX.3 should be the same as ClinicalDocument.code.</p>
			<p>Many fields in the message will overlap in meaning with fields in the CDA document. The following table shows the correspondence between the HL7 V2 MDM message's TXA segment and components of CDA.</p>

				<p>A CDA document is logically broken up into a CDA Header and a CDA Body. The CDA Header is comprised of ClinicalDocument attributes, participants, and act relationships. The CDA Body is the target of the ClinicalDocument component act relationship.</p>
				<p>The ClinicalDocument class inherits various attributes from the <xspecref spec="rim" ref="InfrastructureRoot-cls" alt="InfrastructureRoot class"/> of the RIM, including ClinicalDocument.templateId and ClinicalDocument.typeId. When ClinicalDocument.templateId is valued in an instance, it signals the imposition of a set of template-defined constraints. In addition, the templateId attribute is available in all other CDA classes, thus enabling the imposition of a set of template-defined constraints at any level of granularity. The value of this attribute provides a unique identifier for the template(s) in question. </p>
				<p>ClinicalDocument.typeId is a technology-neutral explicit reference to this CDA, Release Two specification, and must be valued as follows: ClinicalDocument.typeId.root = "2.16.840.1.113883.1.3" (which is the OID for HL7 Registered models); ClinicalDocument.typeId.extension = "POCD_HD000040" (which is the unique identifier for the CDA, Release Two Hierarchical Description).</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="CDA_Header">
				<head>Header</head>
				<p>The purpose of the CDA header is to enable clinical document exchange across and within institutions; facilitate clinical document management; and facilitate compilation of an individual patient's clinical documents into a lifetime electronic patient record. </p>

						<p>The code specifying the particular kind of document (e.g. History and Physical, Discharge Summary, Progress Note). The value set is drawn from LOINC, and has a CWE coding strength. </p>
						<p>Within the LOINC database, beginning with version 2.09, May 2003, document type codes are those that have a value of "DOC" in the Scale component. This subset of LOINC is included in the appendix (see <specref ref="LOINC_Document_Codes"/>).</p>
						<note>
							<p>The hierarchical relationship among LOINC document codes is in evolution. Per the LOINC version 2.14 (December 2004) manual: As soon as possible, the component terms used in the creation of the names of document type codes will be mapped to either the UMLS Metathesaurus or SNOMED CT. This mapping will help to establish the meaning of the terms and will allow aggregation and classification of document type codes based on definitions, computable relationships, and subsumption hierarchies that exist in the reference terminology.</p>

Where these display names are rendered to the clinician, or where the document has a unique title, the ClinicalDocument.title component should be used.

						<p>The CDA is a standard that specifies the structure of exchanged clinical documents. In the case where a local document is transformed into a CDA document for exchange, authentication occurs on the local document, and that fact is reflected in the exchanged CDA document. A CDA document can reflect the unauthenticated, authenticated, or legally authenticated state. The unauthenticated state exists when no authentication information has been recorded (i.e., it is the absence of being either authenticated or legally authenticated).   </p>
						<p>While electronic signatures are not captured in a CDA document, both authentication and legal authentication require that a document has been signed manually or electronically by the responsible individual.

A clinical document can be replaced by a new document and/or appended with an addendum. 

</p>
						<p>A replacement document is a new version of the parent document.  The parent document is considered superseded, but a system may retain it for historical or auditing purposes. The parent document being replaced is referenced via act relationship relatedDocument, where relatedDocument.typeCode is set to equal "RPLC" (for "replaces").  An example is a report found to contain an error that is subsequently replaced by the corrected report.  </p>
						<p>An addendum is a separate document that references the parent document, and may extend or alter the observations in the prior document.  The parent document remains a current component of the patient record, and the addendum and its parent are both read by report recipients. The parent report (represented by the ParentDocument class) being appended is referenced via act relationship relatedDocument, where relatedDocument.typeCode is set to equal "APND" (for "appends"). </p>
						<p>Every CDA document must have a unique ClinicalDocument.id, and thus the replacement or addendum documents each have ClinicalDocument.id that is different from that of the parent document. </p>
						<p>CDA documents may also contain a ClinicalDocument.setId and a ClinicalDocument.versionNumber, which together support a document identification and versioning scheme used in some document management systems.  In this scheme, all documents in a chain of replacements have the same ClinicalDocument.setId and are distinguished by an incrementing ClinicalDocument.versionNumber.  The initial version of a document gets, in addition to a new unique value for ClinicalDocument.id, a new value for ClinicalDocument.setId, and has the value of ClinicalDocument.versionNumber set to equal "1".   A replacement document gets a new globally unique ClinicalDocument.id value, and uses the same value for ClinicalDocument.setId as the parent report being replaced, and increments the value of ClinicalDocument.versionNumber by 1. (Note that version number must be incremented by one when a report is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements.) </p>
						<p>These relationships are illustrated in the following exhibit "Document Identification, Revisions, and Addenda Scenarios". Typical scenarios are a simple relacement (e.g. ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.266" replacing ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123") and a simple append (e.g. ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.456" appends ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123"). More complex scenarios that might be anticipated include: [1] replacement of an addendum (e.g. ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.224" replaces ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.456", which itself is an addendum to ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123") - expected behavior would be to render the replacement as the addendum (e.g. render ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.224" as the addendum to ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123"); [2] addendum to a replaced document (e.g. ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.456" appends ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123", which has been replaced by ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.266") - expected behavior would be to render the addendum along with the replacement (e.g. render ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.456" as an addendum to ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.266").  </p>
						<p>
							<emph role="strong">Document transformations</emph>
						</p>
						<p>A CDA document can be a transformation from some other format, meaning that it has undergone a machine translation from some other format (such as DICOM SR). In this case, relatedDocument.typeCode should be set to "XFRM". </p>
						<p>A proper transformation must ensure that the human readable clinical content of the report is not impacted. Local business rules determine whether or not a transformed report replaces the source, but typically this would not be the case. If it is, an additional relationship of type "RPLC" is to be used. The "XFRM" relationship can also be used when translating a document in a local format into CDA for the purpose of exchange. In this case, the target of the "XFRM" relationship is the local document identifier. </p>

A ServiceEvent can further specialize the act inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, such as where the ClinicalDocument.code is simply "Procedure Report" and the procedure was a "colonoscopy".

							<p>See <specref ref="XML_ID_IDREFS_Pointers"/> for a discussion of referencing in and out of a section's narrative block.</p>
						</note>
						<p>The narrative of each Section, together with the multimedia content referenced in the narrative, comprises the complete authenticated content of the Section. This multimedia content consists of ObservationMedia and RegionOfInterest entries referenced by &lt;renderMultimedia&gt; tags in the Section.text. This is the only case where the entries contain authenticated content that must be rendered with the narrative. </p>
						<p>In terms of the relationship between a section and its entries, CDA defines a default general case, and a more specific case that can be used when applicable.</p>
						<p>The entry relationship is defaulted to "COMP" (component), for the general case where the only assertion is that the related entries are contained within the source section and no other semantics are implied. In this case, the narrative is the original authenticated content. The CDA entries are created by various techniques (e.g., natural language processing, a human coder, a structured data entry tool that outputs both entries and a text report). The method of entry creation may be indicated by the entry participants (e.g., by identifying the algorithm or person that generated them). Relationships between various entries (such as two Observations or an Observation and an ObservationMedia) are encoded using the relationship types defined in <specref ref="entryRelationship"/>.

</p>
						<p>A section may also have no narrative content in the case where the entries represent information that is not part of the clinical content of the document.  A report may embed information referencing evidence data, reagents, calibration or other information that may be used for later processing but is not part of the clinical content.  Such entries are also linked to the Section with ActRelationships possessing typeCode="COMP".</p>
						<p>The entry relationship "DRIV" (is derived from) can be used in the special case where the narrative is fully derived from CDA Entries.  When a report consisting entirely of structured entries is transformed into CDA, the encoding application must ensure that the authenticated content (narrative plus multimedia) is a faithful and complete rendering of the clinical content of the structured source data. This ensures that the narrative plus multimedia represents, as in all CDA documents, the complete authenticated content of the Section.  In this case, narrative plus multimedia does not contain any clinical content that is not present in the Entries.  An example of this case is a DICOM Structured Reporting document of obstetrical measurements made by ultrasound, rendered into a tabular report by a program converting it to CDA narrative block. If the typeCode of the ActRelationship linking these Entries to the Section was "DRIV", it would indicate to a receiving application: 1) the source of the narrative block is the Entries; 2) the contents of the two are equivalent. </p>
						<p>The entries sourced from a Section may have a mix of ActRelationship typeCodes. In such a case, the union of the targets with a "DRIV" relationship are those used to generate the narrative block, and are those that, taken in total, are equivalent to the narrative block. Additional entries with "COMP" relationships are contained within the same section, with no implied semantics.</p>

						<p>There is no requirement that CDA entries must reference into the CDA Narrative Block. The referencing mechanism can be used where it is important to represent the original text component of a coded CDA entry. </p>
						<p>The &lt;content&gt; element contains an optional "revised" attribute that can be valued with "insert" or "delete", which can be used to indicate narrative changes from the last version of a CDA document. The attribute is limited to a single generation, in that it only reflects the changes from the preceding version of a document. If applied, it needs to be used in conjunction with standard CDA revision tracking. Changes to a CDA document that has been released for patient care still require a formal versioning and revision, and the revised document can optionally carry the "revised" attribute to show the delta in the narrative. Receivers are required to interpret the "revised" attribute when rendering by visually distinguishing or suppressing deleted narrative. </p>

						<p>Multimedia that is integral to a document, and part of the attestable content of the document requires the use of the ObservationMedia CDA entry, which is referenced by the &lt;renderMultiMedia&gt; element (see <specref ref="renderMultiMedia"/>).

The linkHtml.name attribute is deprecated, because attributes of type XML ID provide an alternative and more consistent target for referencing.

					<p>CDA entries represent the structured computer-processable components within a document section. Each section can contain zero to many entries. </p>
					<p>Clinical documents contain a wide breadth of content, requiring much of the RIM to enable a full and complete encoding. The current set of CDA entries have been developed in response to identified requirements and scenarios that are in CDA's scope. Rather than creating specific entries for each scenario, similar requirements are merged to create broader entries, which can then be constrained within a particular realm or implementation. This approach is consistent with the approach taken by CEN, DICOM, and OpenEHR.</p>

						<p>Act.negationInd, when set to "true", is a positive assertion that the Act as a whole is negated. Some properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, and the participations are not affected. These properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains the author of the negative Act. An act statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated "finding of wheezing on July 1" means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation. </p>

SubstanceAdministration.rateQuantity can be used to indicate the rate at which the dose is to be administered (e.g., the flow rate for intravenous infusions). SubstanceAdministration.maxDoseQuantity is used to capture the maximum dose of the medication that can be given over a stated time interval (e.g., maximum daily dose of morphine, maximum lifetime dose of doxorubicin).

SubstanceAdministration.effectiveTime is used to describe the timing of administration. It is modeled using the GTS data type to accommodate various dosing scenarios, as illustrated in the following example.</p>

The LabeledDrug class, which is an Entity class playing the Role of Manufactured Product, identifies the drug that is consumed in the substance administration. The medication is identified by means of the LabeledDrug.code or the LabeledDrug.name. The Material entity is used to identify non-drug administered substances such as vaccines and blood products.

						<p>The Supply class represents dispensing, whereas the SubstanceAdministration class represents administration. Prescriptions are complex activities that involve both an administration request to the patient (e.g. take digoxin 0.125mg by mouth once per day) and a supply request to the pharmacy (e.g. dispense 30 tablets, with 5 refills). This should be represented in CDA by a SubstanceAdministration entry that has a component Supply entry. The nested Supply entry can have Supply.independentInd set to "false" to signal that the Supply cannot stand alone, without it's containing SubstanceAdministration. The following example illustrates a prescription representation in CDA.</p>

						<p>The entryRelationship.inversionInd can be set to "true" to indicate that the relationship should be interpreted as if the roles of the source and target entries were reversed. In the example in the table above, "treadmill test" RSON (has reason) "chest pain". Inverted, this would have "chest pain" as the source and "treadmill test" as the target: "chest pain" RSON (inverted) "treadmill test". Inversion can be useful when the current context is describing the target of an act relationship that needs to be related back to the source.</p>
						<p>

The entryRelationship.contextConductionInd differs from the otherwise common use of this attribute (see <specref ref="CDAContext"/>) in that in all other cases where this attribute is used, the value is fixed at "true", whereas here the value is defaulted to "true", and can be changed to "false" when referencing an entry in the same document. Setting the context conduction to false when referencing an entry in the same document keeps clear the fact that the referenced object retains its original context.</p>

						<p>CDA entries can reference external objects such as external images and prior reports. These external objects are not part of the authenticated document content. They contain sufficient attributes to enable an explicit reference rather than duplicating the entire referenced object. The CDA entry that wraps the external reference can be used to encode the specific portions of the external reference that are addressed in the narrative block.</p>
						<p>Each object allows for an identifier and a code, and contains the RIM Act.text attribute, which can be used to store the URL and MIME type of the object. External objects always have a fixed moodCode of "EVN". </p>
						<p>The reference class contains the attribute reference.seperatableInd, which indicates whether or not the source is intended to be interpreted independently of the target. The indicator cannot prevent an individual or application from separating the source and target, but indicates the author's desire and willingness to attest to the content of the source if separated from the target. Typically, where seperatableInd is "false", the exchanged package should include the target of the reference so that the recipient can render it. </p>

			<div2 id="CDAContext">
				<head>CDA Context</head>
				<p>CDA context is set in the CDA header and applies to the entire document. Context can be overridden at the level of the body, section, and/or CDA entry.</p>
				<div3 id="Overview_of_CDA_Context">
					<head>Overview of CDA Context</head>
					<p>A document, in a sense, is a contextual wrapper for its contents. Assertions in the document header are typically applicable to statements made in the body of the document, unless overridden. For instance, the patient identified in the header is assumed to be the subject of observations described in the body of the document, unless a different subject is explicitly stated, or the author identified in the header is assumed to be the author of the entire document, unless a different author is explicitly identified on a section. The objective of the CDA context rules are to make these practices explicit with relationship to the RIM, such that a computer will understand the context of a portion of a document the same way that a human interprets it. </p>
					<p>At the same time, there is no guarantee that machine processing will identify a mistaken application of contextual rules. If a physician records an "outside diagnosis" in narrative but does not nullify the "informant" context, machine processing will not identify the switch in attribution. This is a special case illustrating the limits of automated validation of electronic records and would apply regardless of the context inheritance mechanism. In other words, from some errors of encoding, there is no recovery other than human review.</p>
					<p>CDA's approach to context, and the propagation of that context to nested document components, follows these design principles:

<list role="unordered">
							<item>CDA uses the RIM context mechanism (contextControlCode for Participations; contextConductionInd  for ActRelationships), and assigns fixed values to these attributes to accomplish the design objectives below, thus constraining the RIM context model. CDA extends the context propagation property to designated attributes of the CDA Header, which also propagate through any ActRelationship for which contextConductionInd="true".</item>
							<item>The CDA Header sets context for the entire document. A propagating value specified in the document header holds true throughout the document, unless explicitly overridden. This principal applies to both Participations and to designated attributes of the CDA Header. Contextual header components (i.e., those that have propagating values) include:

<list role="unordered">
									<item>Author</item>
									<item>Confidentiality</item>
									<item>Data enterer</item>
									<item>Human language</item>
									<item>Informant</item>
									<item>Legal authenticator</item>
									<item>Participant</item>
									<item>Record target</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>Context components that can be overridden at the level of the document body include:



<list role="unordered">
									<item>Confidentiality</item>
									<item>Human language</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>Context components that can be overridden at the level of a document section include:

<list role="unordered">
									<item>Author</item>
									<item>Confidentiality</item>
									<item>Human language</item>
									<item>Informant</item>
									<item>Subject</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>Context components that can be overridden at the level of a CDA entry include:

<list role="unordered">
									<item>Author</item>
									<item>Human language</item>
									<item>Informant</item>
									<item>Participant</item>
									<item>Subject</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>Context propagates from outer tags to nested tags. Context that is specified on an outer tag holds true for all nested tags, unless overridden on a nested tag. Context specified on a tag within the CDA body always overrides context propagated from an outer tag. For instance, the specification of authorship at a document section level overrides all authorship propagated from outer tags.

</item>
							<item>Context is sometimes known precisely, and is sometimes unknown, such as in the case where a document is comprised of a large unparsed narrative block that potentially includes statements that contradict outer context. Because CDA context always propagates unless overridden, the representation of unknown context is achieved by overriding with a null value.

				<div3 id="Technical_Aspects_of_CDA_Context">
					<head>Technical Aspects of CDA Context</head>
					<p>The RIM defines the "context" of an act as those participants of the act that can be propagated to nested acts. In the RIM, whether or not contextual participants do propagate to nested acts depends on whether or not the intervening act relationship between parent and child act allows for conduction of context. The explicit representation of context, and whether or not the context on an act can propagate to nested acts, is expressed via the RIM attributes Participation.contextControlCode and ActRelationship.contextConductionInd. CDA constrains the general RIM context mechanism such that context always overrides and propagates, as shown in the following table.</p>

					<p>The following exhibit illustrates the CDA context model. ClinicalDocument has an author participant, a confidentialityCode, and a languageCode, all of which will propagate to nested acts. The component act relationship going from ClinicalDocument to bodyChoice has contextConductionInd fixed as "true", thus allowing for the propagation of context. The bodyChoice classes, NonXMLBody and StructuredBody, contain a confidentialityCode and languageCode which can be used to override the value specified in the header. The component act relationship going from StructuredBody to Section has contextConductionInd fixed at "true", thus the context on StructuredBody will propagate through to Section. Section can override confidentialityCode, languageCode, and author. A null value for the Section's author participant indicates that the author for that particular section is unknown.</p>

						<emph role="strong">Introduction</emph>
					</p>
					<p>There are an ever-increasing variety of tools and techniques for creating CDA documents:

<list role="ordered">
							<item>Transcription: most clinical documents are created through a voice interface. CDA is available as an output from transcription vendors large and small today. Some are integrating natural language processing to provide coded structures within dictated CDAs.</item>
							<item>EMR/EHR: many electronic medical record vendors have CDA output capability, although they provide it on-demand, not as a standard feature. For EMRs, CDA is relatively simple type of report.</item>
							<item>XML forms: a new generation of XML tools for forms generation can create CDA on output. </item>
							<item>Knowledge base: at least one major US provider has built a CDA editor on top of a knowledge base for guided, structured entry.</item>
							<item>Dynamic query: dynamic assembly of CDA documents is used in some distributed applications to prepopulate documents from existing data stores, such as lab result databases. This method can be used in conjunction with any of the others. 

</item>
						</list>
					</p>
					<p>This appendix considers not the specific tools and technologies, but is intended as a general guide to use of CDA in document creation.</p>
					<p>
						<emph role="strong">Before you start: RIM compliance</emph>
						<list role="unordered">
							<item>structures, vocabulary, datatypes</item>
						</list>
					</p>
					<p>Creating a CDA-compliant instance, by definition, means that the information contained within is defined by the HL7 RIM. Regardless of your starting point or method of document generation, when you are done, the computable semantics of the document will derive their meaning from the relationship between RIM classes, controlled vocabulary and the V3 RIM datatypes. Any CDA-generation implementation must start with an examination of how document requirements relate to the RIM, the datatypes and vocabulary. </p>
					<p>The RIM, however, is a highly abstract model and recognizes many extensive vocabulary domains. While RIM-mapping is a necessary condition for CDA generation, it is not sufficient to determine the method of generation or to drive a user interface for document creation.</p>
					<p>
						<emph role="strong">An exchange specification, not an authoring specification</emph>
						<list role="unordered">
							<item>CDA is not deterministic for document creation</item>
						</list>
					</p>
					<p>CDA is a specification for the exchange form of a clinical document. A CDA schema can validate many of the conformance requirements, but will be too general for most authoring applications. In general, standards for interoperability and broadbased exchange will not directly drive an authoring GUI. Given the extent of the CDA domain – clinical care – the requirements for generalized exchange overlap with, but don’t match, the requirements for driving an authoring interface. </p>
					<p>For example, the CDA requirement for human readability demands that a single stylesheet render the authenticated clinical content of any CDA document. If CDA elements were defined in the generic schema that corresponds to the sections of a document, &lt;historyOfPresentIllness&gt; or &lt;Subjective&gt;, for example, a stylesheet would need to recognize each of these tags as section-level tags and render them accordingly. The CDA approach, defining &lt;section&gt; and asserting the type of section through coded vocabulary means that not only is the CDA extensible through the externally-maintained vocabulary domains, but that document designers have the flexibility to create hierarchies of sections and to name and tag them according to local requirements, while maintaining compatibility for the exchange context. Thus, while specific tagging that makes it easier to drive a GUI is fine locally, where practice can be more tightly constrained, CDA needs to take a more general approach. </p>
					<p>Both sets of requirements, for authoring and for exchange, should be recognized. Within a defined community of interest, such as a single business enterprise, a professional society or in some cases, local and regional health authorities, there can be tight agreement on the form of a document so that the authoring definitions and the exchange definitions coincide. Unless and until there is universal agreement, there can be no universal exchange unless the diversity of local requirements is acknowledged. This is a long-winded way of saying that CDA will remain a general exchange standard, and other approaches must be available to define data entry and document creation validation requirements. </p>
					<p>General approaches: constrain or transform

<list role="unordered">
							<item>constrain: emit valid CDA directly from the authoring system using a schema that isn’t CDA </item>
							<item>transform: example - emit local XML, map to CDA 

</item>
						</list>
					</p>
					<p>Given that CDA is not an authoring schema, there are two logical alternatives to creating valid CDA instances. </p>
					<p>The first is to add constraints to the CDA schema so that the resulting specification defines a particular document type (see the following exhibit "Creating a CDA through a local schema"). There are several technologies available for adding constraints. One approach is to modify the CDA schema itself to a local variant (local.cda.xsd below). Modifications could include limiting the levels of nesting; constraining vocabulary and sequence, for example requiring that a section with a LOINC code for "Subjective" initiate the document body and be followed by a section coded "Objective". These modifications could be expressed in W3C Schema or as Xpath statements within the local schema. Instances that validate against this constrained, local version of CDA are, by definition, also valid CDA instances.</p>

						<graphic source="cda_figure3.gif"/>
					</exhibit>
					<p>Templates are one type of constraint. HL7 is in the process of defining a formal template mechanism (see <specref ref="The_A_in_CDA"/>). </p>
					<p>The second approach is to create a local schema and then transform the local XML instance to CDA </p>

					<head>LOINC Document Codes</head>
					<p>The following table is drawn from <loc href="http://www.loinc.org/" target="_blank">LOINC, version 2.14, December 2004</loc>, and equals the subset whose scale = "DOC" (and whose status &lt;&gt; "DEL"). The LOINC document model includes a component for "type of service" (conveyed in the Component field), "setting" (conveyed in the System field), "subject matter domain" (conveyed in the Method_Type field), and "training / professional level" (also conveyed in the Method_Type field). </p>
					<p>The type of service characterizes the kind of service or activity that was provided to/for the patient (or other subject of the service) as described in the note. Common subclasses of service would be examinations, evaluations, and management.  The notion of time sequence, e.g. at the beginning (admission) at the end (discharge) and is subsumed in the axis.</p>
					<p>The setting is a modest extension of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) coarse definition of settings. Setting is not equivalent to location, which typically has more locally defined meanings.</p>
					<p>The subject matter domain characterized the subject matter or clinical categorization of a note. The training / professional level characterizes the training or professional level of the author of the document.</p>

					<head>CDA and Semantic Interoperability</head>
					<p>A long term objective of CDA and other specifications in the V3 family is to achieve increasingly greater and greater "semantic interoperability", which might be defined as the ability of two applications to share data, with no prior negotiations, such that decision support within each application continues to function reliably when processed against the received data.</p>
					<p>CDA seeks to achieve the highest level of constraint that can exist in an international standard. Where international consensus is lacking, and where uses cases in different realms currently preclude consensus, CDA will need to be necessarily inclusive. In such areas, ongoing harmonization and consensus building will further enable semantic interopability, which will be reflected in future iterations of CDA. </p>
					<p>While the framework provided by the RIM and by CDA and by the shared HL7 Clinical Statement Model are a critical component of semantic interoperability, they are not currently sufficient, particularly given the lack of global terminology solution, and the fact that each terminology overlaps with the RIM in different ways. Such terminology solutions are outside the scope of CDA, and will need to be addressed in various national and international forums.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 id="Enumeration_of_Changes_Between_Release_One_and_Release_Two">
					<head>Changes from CDA Release 1</head>
					<p>CDA, Release One became an ANSI-approved HL7 Standard in November, 2000, representing the first specification derived from the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM). Since then, the RIM has matured, as has the methodology used to derive RIM-based specifications. In addition, early adopters are posing new use cases for incorporation. </p>
					<p>The basic model of CDA, Release Two is essentially unchanged. A CDA document has a header and a body. The body contains nested sections. These sections can be coded using standard vocabularies, and can contain "entries". CDA, Release One entries included such things as character data, hyperlinks, and multimedia. </p>
					<p>The main evolutionary steps in CDA, Release Two are that both header and body are fully RIM-derived, and there is a much richer assortment of entries to use within CDA sections. CDA, Release Two enables clinical content to be formally expressed to the extent that is it modeled in the RIM.</p>
					<p>CDA, Release Two takes advantage of HL7’s growing expertise in creating model-based XML standards. Given the evolution of the RIM and the HL7 development methodology since November 2000, there are a number of changes between the new and the old CDA. </p>
					<div3 id="Deprecated_Components">
						<head>Deprecated Components</head>
