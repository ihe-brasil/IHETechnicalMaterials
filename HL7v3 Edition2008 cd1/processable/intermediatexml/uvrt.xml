The committee defines messages, document structures, and terminology to support the systems and processes used in the collection, storage, distribution, integration and analysis of such information.

After the data have been collected, derived measurements such as QT interval are used to draw conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of the candidate drug. Standards exist for transmitting these derived data and their analysis results from the trial sponsor to the regulatory agencies; but these submissions have not historically included representation of the waveforms, or have at best included an image of the device-generated paper waveform. A new request to include the digital waveform, the algorithmic representations, and the annotations identifying the relevant landmarks (e.g. QRS-wave onset, T-wave offset) that support derived ECG measurements has been proposed by the US FDA.  This specification will be used to package such annotated digital waveform data produced by an ECG analysis system for transmission from trial sponsor to a regulatory agency.  A medical device that acquires waveforms directly from patients for presentation to caregivers in support of patient care (e.g., ECG monitors, 12 lead ECG carts, ambulatory ECG recorders, pulse oximeters, etc.) may, but is not required to, comply with this specification.</p><p><emph>Limitations on the Annotated ECG Standard</emph></p><p>Application of this Annotated ECG message is limited to human subjects only.  At this time, no provisions have been made to capture information about animals such as breed and species.</p><p>There is no capability to break down the trial into phases, parts, arms, etc. in this message.  Therefore, treatment assignments and study events all apply to the trial as a whole.</p><p>This message is intended to interchange annotated ECG waveforms recorded only from the person designated as the trial subject.</p><p>Future extensions may include the ability to reference non-human subjects, to specify subparts of trials, and to collect waveforms from individuals of interest other than trial subjects.</p></descriptive><storydivn identifier="sbs-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg" name="Storyboards" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic" id="sbs-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic"><descriptive identifier="sstop-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg" name="Reference" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic" id="sstop-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic"><p>For details on the interpretation of this section, see <xspecref spec="v3guide.htm" ref="v3gstory" alt="the storyboard discussion"/> in the Version 3 Guide.</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="sstoScp-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg" name="Introduction" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic" id="sstoScp-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic"><p>The Storyboard is presented as a high-level description of the business situation the standard is designed to address, accompanied by a diagram of the interactions that will be described in the narratives that follow.

The sponsor decides the effects to be studied can be seen in ECG data, or information derived from ECG data.  The sponsor designs a protocol specifying the population to be studied, the data to be collected, the equipment to be used for gathering the ECG data, the analysis tools to use, and how any effects will be studied using the ECG data and analysis tools.</p><p>The sponsor (or a Contract Research Organization (CRO) engaged by the sponsor) hires investigators to collect the data, and the investigators in turn enroll subjects in the trial.  The subject visits the collection site.  During the subject's visit, equipment is connected to the subject.  The equipment records the subject's ECG along with other physiologic parameters, if appropriate.  Trial and subject identifying information is associated with the ECG data, such as subject id, gender, date of birth, investigator and site id's, protocol id, etc.  After the individual ECGs are collected from the subject for that visit, it is transferred to a central ECG lab for analysis.</p><p>The ECG waveforms can be loaded into an analysis tool for making findings (measurements) and possibly deriving other data according to the trial protocol.  The findings are oftentimes in the form of time and amplitude values for the parts of the cardiac process being studied.  The analysis produces two types of information: findings to be used for further statistical analysis on the entire population enrolled in the trial, and annotated ECG waveforms with trial specific fiducial markings, etc. indicating key features used for obtaining the findings.  The annotated ECG waveforms are forwarded to the trial sponsor (interaction: AnnotatedECG Revised, Notification (<artref ref="PORT_IN020001UV01" alt="PORT_IN020001"></artref>)), who can include them without ammendment in a trial submission, or may supply some additional data not present in the notification from the central ECG lab.  In the latter case, the sponsor is responsible for maintaining an audit trail of changes made to the message as received.</p><p>Should any errors be discovered in the message after notification, the deletion interaction (interaction: AnnotatedECG Deleted, Notification (<artref ref="PORT_IN020002UV01" alt="PORT_IN020002"></artref>)) is issued by the central ECG lab, and a new notification message with the corrected information is issued (interaction: AnnotatedECG Revised, Notification (<artref ref="PORT_IN020001UV01" alt="PORT_IN020001"></artref>)).</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORT_SN020002UV01" name="AnnotatedECG_03" familiarName="Submitting Annotated ECGs" parent="PORT_ST020001UV01-str" id="PORT_ST020001UV01-PORT_SN020002UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="10|_01" baseClass="Annotatedecg" lastEdit="2008-06-05T16:50:05" class="changed"><p>Interaction: AnnotatedECG Submittable, Notification (<artref ref="PORT_IN020003UV01" alt="PORT_IN020003"></artref>)</p><p>The supporting annotated ECG waveforms become part of the sponsor's submission to the regulatory agency.   The communication of the annotated ECG waveforms from the sponsor to the regulatory agency (interaction: AnnotatedECG Submittable, Notification (<artref ref="PORT_IN020003UV01" alt="PORT_IN020003"></artref>)) is the primary focus of this standard.</p><p>During the regulatory agency's review of a submission, the Agency may come across a conclusion drawn from a statistical analysis of ECG findings it wishes to investigate further.  The reviewer may review the ECG analysis protocol and the analysis dataset.  The reviewer may question an ECG finding in the dataset and review the annotated ECG waveforms.  The reviewer may be satisfied with what he sees or may investigate further the ECG measurement protocol and its consistent application during the trial.</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORT_SN020003UV01" name="AnnotatedECG_04" familiarName="Business Requirements for this Storyboard" parent="PORT_ST020001UV01-str" id="PORT_ST020001UV01-PORT_SN020003UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="10|_01" baseClass="Annotatedecg" lastEdit="2008-06-05T17:10:43" class="changed"><p><emph role="strong">Data Describing the Clinical Trial Context of the Annotated ECG</emph></p><p><emph>Clinical Trial Context Diagram for Annotated ECGs: </emph><graphic source="T-PORT_NA020020.gif" alt="T-PORT_NA020020.gif"></graphic></p><p>The annotated ECG waveforms are the focus of this message.  For each annotated ECG, information is included describing the trial conditions under which the ECG was recorded.  At a minimum, the unique identifiers for the ECG, the trial subject, the trial itself are required.  In addition to the required identifiers, the message must contain the time of the ECG data collection.  This is the minimal set of data considered necessary to properly identify an ECG within a regulatory submission.</p><p>These requirements are included in the diagram above, which shows the annotated ECG itself as a category of data to be included in the message.  Other trial context categories are also shown, along with the relationships among the categories.  All of the individual trial context data items that can be communicated using the HL7 Annotated ECG message are listed and categorized on the diagram, with an indication of whether they are optional or required.  Some entity-relationship (ER) constructs and conventions have been used in this diagram, as described in the key, but this is not intended to be a formal ER diagram.</p><p><emph role="strong">Data Describing the Annotations and Waveforms</emph></p><p><emph>ECG Data Breakdown Diagram for Annotated ECGs: </emph><graphic source="PORT_NA020030.gif" alt="PORT_NA020030.gif"></graphic></p><p>The diagram above shows how the waveforms and annotations are organized relative to the main Annotated ECG object from the previous diagram.  Starting from the bottom of the diagram, each lead and the time associated with the samples is represented as a Sequence -- a sequence of values.  Each Sequence has a type (lead name or time type) and the list of values.</p><p>Sequences that were recorded simultaneously are grouped as Sequence Sets.  A modern electrocardiograph can represent a 12-lead ECG as a single Sequence Set.  A 3 channel electrocardiograph would typically use 4 Sequence Sets for a 12-lead ECG (e.g. set 1 having leads I, II, III, set 2 having leads aVR, aVF, aVL, set 3 having leads V1, V2, V3, and set 4 having leads V4, V5, V5).</p><p>A Series contains all the Sequence Sets that share a common frame of reference.  Typically, the Series will contain the data collected from a single device with a single time reference.  If a representative beat is algorithmically derived from the rhythm data, it will form another Series (derived from the rhythm data Series).</p><p>A number of Annotation Sets can be attached to the Series.  The Annotation Sets contain an arbitrary nesting of Annotations.  The nesting of Annotations allows parent/child relationships to be communicated.  For example, a Beat annotation can be the parent of Wave Component annotations (P-wave, QRS-wave, T-wave, etc.).</p><p>If an annotation has a location within the Series, it is associated with a Region Of Interest (ROI).  The ROI specifies the leads and time period for the annotation.   A fully specified ROI contains a Boundary for each lead and/or time dimension within it.  A partially specified ROI will contain a Boundary for each lead and/or time that is not wholly in it.  For example, if a global QRS onset is to be specified, a partially specified ROI will only have a Boundary for the time dimension.  It is assumed that all the other dimensions (leads) are wholly in the ROI.</p></descriptive><diagref ref="PORT_ST020001UV01.gif"/><intref ref="PORT_IN020001UV01-int" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="AnnotatedECG Revised, Notification" refFamiliarName="AnnotatedECG Revised, Notification" refIdentifier="PORT_IN020001UV01" sequence="1"/><intref ref="PORT_IN020002UV01-int" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="AnnotatedECG Deleted, Notification" refFamiliarName="AnnotatedECG Deleted, Notification" refIdentifier="PORT_IN020002UV01" sequence="2"/><intref ref="PORT_IN020003UV01-int" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="AnnotatedECG Submittable, Notification" refFamiliarName="AnnotatedECG Submittable, Notification" refIdentifier="PORT_IN020003UV01" sequence="3"/></story></storydivn><approledivn identifier="roles-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg" name="Application Roles" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic" id="roles-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic"><descriptive identifier="arop-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg" name="Reference" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic" id="arop-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic"><p>For details on the interpretation of this section, see <xspecref spec="v3guide.htm" ref="v3gapprole" alt="the discussion of application roles"/> and their relationships in the Version 3 Guide.</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="arScp-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg" name="Introduction" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic" id="arScp-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic"><p>The AnnotatedECG topic has three application roles, two of which are shared with the CTLaboratory topic in this domain.  </p><p>Those shared application roles are defined under the CTLaboratory topic.

The protocol-specified name and code (if any) for the benchmark are captured in the code attribute of this Reference Event class.</p><p>The RelativeTimepoint class represents the (scheduled) time for the specific ECG relative to the Reference Event, and the offset value (positive or negative amount and UOM for the offset of the ECG from the benchmark) is captured in the pauseQuantity attribute of the componentOf relationship between the ProtocolTimepointEvent and the RelativeTimepoint classes.</p><p>Performer information for each ECG Series is captured in the R-MIM's ECGPerformer role and its related Person.</p><p>The Transaction Action information is captured in the message wrapper (not shown here).</p><p><emph>Business Model Category: Annotated ECG Related Observation</emph></p><p>All business information in this category is captured in the R-MIM's RelatedObservation class, where the code identifies the type and name for the observation (eg. age, fasting status) and the value captures the observation itself.</p><p><emph>Business Model Category: Annotated ECG Related Comment</emph></p><p>All business information in this category is captured in the R-MIM's FindingComment class, where the code identifies the type and name for the comment and the value captures the comment itself.</p><p><emph>Business Model Category: Study Event</emph></p><p>All of the business information in this category is captured in the TimepointEvent class of the R-MIM, except performer information, which is represented by the StudyEventPerformer class and its related Person.</p><p>Each AnnotatedECG must be assigned to exactly one TimepointEvent. If the protocol does not include the notion of timepoint or study events, then the entire trial is considered a single timepoint event.</p><p><emph>Business Model Categories: Clinical Trial; Trial Site; Trial Site Investigator</emph></p><p>The Clinical Trial category in the business model has a counterpart ClinicalTrial class in the R-MIM. This class captures the sponsor's name and code for the trial (not the protocol) in the id and title attributes. The activityTime attribute captures the start and end dates (and times, if necessary) for the entire trial.</p><p>The name and identifier for the sponsor is represented in the Organization class, which plays the role of ClinicalTrialSponsor, and participates in the trial as the trial's author.</p><p>Trial site information (id, name, country) is captured in the TrialSite role class, or in the Location entity class which plays that role.</p><p>Similarly, trial investigator information (id, name) is captured in the TrialInvestigator and Person classes. The identifier of the person as an investigator should appear in the TrialInvestigator role id.</p><p><emph>Business Model Category: Planned Study</emph></p><p>Planned Study in the business model represents the protocol controlling the individual clinical trial. It is possible for several individual clinical trials to be controlled by the same protocol. The id and name for the controlling protocol for this specific trial are captured in the ClinicalTrialProtocol class of the R-MIM.</p><p><emph>Business Model Categories: Trial Subject; Subject Assignment</emph></p><p>Most of the trial subject information is captured in the R-MIM classes TrialSubject (subject id) and DemographicPerson (initials, birthdate, gender, race).</p><p>As in the business model, the R-MIM class SubjectAssignment serves to associate the subject with a particular trial, site and investigator. Assignment to a trial is mandatory; assignment to a site and investigator are optional.</p><p>In the R-MIM, the SubjectAssignment class also serves to associate the subject with the treatment group to which he/she is assigned for the trial.</p><p><emph role="strong">REPRESENTATION IN THE R-MIM OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT WAVEFORMS AND ANNOTATIONS</emph></p><p>The R-MIM class Series contains the rhythm waveforms directly recorded from the subject, or the representative beat waveforms derived from the rhythm waveforms. The code attribute indicates if the series contains rhythm waveforms or representative beat waveforms.</p><p>The Series attribute effectiveTime captures the interval of time for the waveforms (usually recorded by the device). The effectiveTime for rhythm waveforms is the actual time of data collection. The effectiveTime for a representative beat is the period of time from which the beat was derived.</p><p>The Series can have a unique id, usually assigned by the device that authored it. This unique id can be different from the id of the AnnotatedECG because there can potentially be several Series contributing to a single AnnotatedECG (for a single TimepointEvent and RelativeTimepoint). The Series id also allows annotations in other messages to be associated with the Series.</p><p>The Series is authored by a Device playing a ManufacturedProduct role. The role is scoped by the Organization that manufactured the device. The Device entity captures the id, code (type), model name, and software name. The Organization entity captures the manufacturer's id and name.</p><p>If necessary, id's and names (or initials) of one or more technicians acquiring the ECG data can be captured as the Series SecondaryPerformer.  The SecondaryPerformer is commonly referred to as the "ECG Technician".</p><p>If the Series is a representative beat, and it was derived from a portion of the rhythm series, it is supported by an ROI (Region Of Interest). The ROI specifies which segment of time the representative beat was derived from.</p><p>The Series has one or more SequenceSet components. There is one SequenceSet for each set of ECG leads that were simultaneously acquired. A modern electrocardiograph can simultaneously capture all 12 leads of a 12-lead ECG, and therefore only requires a single SequenceSet. A 3-channel electrocardiograph, on the other hand, must acquire the 12 leads 3 at a time. A 3-channel device would typically use 4 SequenceSets for a 12-lead ECG.</p><p>Each SequenceSet contains a Sequence for the time base and each lead simultaneously acquired. For example, a 12-lead ECG represented in a single SequenceSet would have 13 Sequences: one for time, and one for each of the 12 leads. The type of Sequence is captured in the code attribute, and the sample values are captured in the value attribute (as a list). The ECG lead types from the ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 standard will be used for the code attribute whenever appropriate.</p><p>It is important to note that HL7 provides a couple of special datatypes for representing the values of a Sequence. If the Sequence contains a regular pattern of values (such as evenly sampled time), the GLIST (generated list) collection type can generate the sequence of values from a few parameters (e.g. initial value and increment). If the Sequence contains values in native integer device units, the SLIST (sampled list) collection type can specify scale and translate factors so the native integers can be placed in the message</p><p>The Series, SequenceSet, and/or Sequence can be associated with one or more ControlVariables. A ControlVariable captures additional information about how the waveforms were created. For example, if the waveforms had filtering applied, the filter settings should be captured as ControlVariables. The ControlVariable code captures the type of variable (e.g. low pass filter), and the value captures the variable's setting (e.g. 150 Hz).</p><p>AnnotationSets can be associated with a Series.  The activityTime of the set captures when the set of annotations were made.  Each set of annotations can have a common author and common ControlVariables.  The author can be a Device or a Person playing the AssignedEntity role. The id of the AssignedEntity captures the trial specific id of the annotator. The scoping Organization captures the id and name of the organization making the annotation via the Device or Person.  ControlVariables can be associated with the AnnotationSet to capture important details about the annotation method (e.g. algorithm settings such as criteria used to classify tachycardia, etc.).</p><p>Each AnnotationSet contains one or more annotations for the Series. Each Annotation has a code specifying what type of annotation it is, and when appropriate, the value attribute specifies the annotations's value. The ECG nomenclature from the ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 standard will be used for the Annotation codes and values whenever possible.</p><p>Annotations can contain child annotations when appropriate. For example, it may be necessary to communicate that a P-wave, QRS-wave, and T-wave all belong to the same beat. A beat annotation could then contain child annotations for each of the wave components. Likewise, it might be necessary to group all the fiducial markings related to a particular ECG measurement, like QTc. A QTc annotation could have child annotations for a couple R-peaks, a QRS-wave, and a T-wave. If the QTc was calculated from several beats, each beat's QTc fiducial markings could make up another level in the hierarchy.</p><p>Each Annotation can be supported by an ROI. The ROI specifies where in the Series the Annotation applies. For example, if the Annotation is a T-wave, the ROI will specify a Boundary in time for the beginning and end of the T-wave, and optionally a Boundary for each Lead that is included.</p><p>The ROI code attribute says whether the ROI is partially or fully specified by its Boundaries. A partially specified ROI only include Boundaries for dimensions that are constrained. All other unspecified dimensions would be included in the ROI. For example, a global QRS-wave could be annotated with a partially specified ROI with only a time Boundary. A fully specified ROI, on the other hand, only includes the dimensions that are named as Boundaries. So, if the QRS-wave is only observed in Lead II, then a Boundary for time and a Boundary for Lead II would be specified. All other unnamed dimensions would not be included in the ROI.</p><p>The code attribute of the Boundary names the dimension being bounded. These codes should match the codes used in the Sequence instances. For example, if the Series contains a Sequence for absolute time, and an ROI needs to bound that time, the same code for absolute time is used as the Boundary code. The Boundary's value attribute is usually an interval capturing the optional start and optional end of the ROI within that dimension. However, if the value is truly a single point (e.g. R-wave peak), then the value attribute will contain a single value, not an interval.</p><p>The Boundary values can be used to communicate several things. If a T-wave Annotation is used to communicate the offset of T, the ROI's time boundary would only specify the interval's high value. The low value can be unspecified. Likewise, if the beginning of the a P-wave is to be communicated, the ROI time boundary would only specify the interval's low value.</p><p>The relationship between the Annotation and its ROI can also be used to communicate a couple of different concepts. If the relationship is the more general "has support", the ROI communicates boundaries that aren't necessarily the true boundaries of the annotation. For example, if atrial flutter is observed in the waveforms, but the true beginning and ending of the flutter episode is not observed, the annotation "has support" from the ROI (but it's not the full story). On the other hand, if the true beginning and end of atrial flutter is observed, the "has bounded support" relationship can be used. In other words, the annotation's ROI supports AND defines the true boundaries. </p></descriptive><diagref ref="PORT_RM020001UV.gif"/><hmdref role="containedHMD" ref="PORT_HD020001UV01-hmd" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="AnnotatedECG_09" refFamiliarName="AnnotatedECG  - Clinical Trials" refIdentifier="PORT_HD020001UV01"/></rmim></rmimdivn><hmddivn identifier="hmds-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg" name="Hierarchical Message Descriptions" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic" id="hmds-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic"><descriptive identifier="hdop-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg" name="Reference" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic" id="hdop-PORT_DO000001UV-Annotatedecg-ic"><p>For details on the interpretation of this section, see <xspecref spec="v3guide.htm" ref="v3ghmd" alt="the description of HMDs"/> in the Version 3 Guide.</p></descriptive><hmd identifier="PORT_HD020001UV01" name="AnnotatedECG_09" familiarName="AnnotatedECG  - Clinical Trials" parent="PORT_RM020001UV01-rmi" id="PORT_HD020001UV01-hmd" sortPrefix="10|99|99|_09" baseClass="Annotatedecg" ballotStatus="NormativeStandard" ballotNumber="1" lastEdit="2004-07-22T19:01:26"><descriptive identifier="desc-PORT_HD020001UV01" name="Description" parent="PORT_HD020001UV01-hmd" id="desc-PORT_HD020001UV01-hmd" lastEdit="2004-07-22T19:01:26"><p>The AnnotatedECG - Clinical Trials HMD is based upon the Annotated ECG - Clinical Trials R-MIM.

The company has hired a central laboratory to perform the specimen testing and a contract research organization (CRO) to collect, clean and compile the study data as the sponsor's agent.</p><p>The clinical trial is to be performed at multiple study sites, with each study site having multiple investigators.  Each candidate subject is screened for eligibility, and is assigned an identifier solely for this screening process. If the candidate subject is found to qualify to participate in the study, the subject is enrolled and assigned a subject identifier for the study.  Throughout the subject's participation (candidate and enrolled), the subject is assigned to one or another investigator at the site at which the subject is participating.  Subjects may be reassigned to new sites and/or investigators during the course of the subject's participation in the study.</p><p>Specimens are collected from each subject during both the screening and enrolled phases for that subject.  These specimens are forwarded to the central laboratory, along with information identifying the subject and the specific point in the study at which the specimen was collected.  The central laboratory accessions these specimens.  The laboratory also assigns an additional identifier to each subject for use within the laboratory's own processing.  The central laboratory may forward some or all of the specimen material to another laboratory for testing.</p><p>The laboratory responsible for testing performs the tests specified in the sponsor's protocol for each specimen, and records the results in its own data management system.  Data from other than the central laboratory is forwarded to the central laboratory, which is responsible for reporting all results to the sponsor/agent.</p><p>At agreed-upon points, the central laboratory reports all results developed since the last reporting point (including updates and deletions) to the CRO (interaction: CTLaboratory Periodic Report to Sponsor/Agent (<artref ref="PORT_IN030001UV01" alt="PORT_IN030001"></artref>)).  As each subject completes the study, and after all anomalies in that subject's data have been resolved, the CRO reports all results for that subject to the sponsor (interaction: CTLaboratory Periodic Report to Sponsor/Agent (<artref ref="PORT_IN030001UV01" alt="PORT_IN030001"></artref>)).</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORT_SN030002UV01" name="CTLaboratory_03" familiarName="Business Requirements for this Storyboard" parent="PORT_ST030001UV01-str" id="PORT_ST030001UV01-PORT_SN030002UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="20|_01" baseClass="Ctlaboratory" lastEdit="2008-06-05T17:11:46" class="changed"><p>The CDISC Laboratory Data Interchange Standard Version 1.0 (www.CDISC.org) has been taken as the foundation for the HL7 Version 3 message presented in this domain.</p><p><artref ref="file:CDISC_Laboratory_Interchange_Std_V1.0.1.zip" alt="Click here to access the CDISC Standard."></artref></p><p>The CDISC standard data requirements are represented in the following diagram:</p><p><graphic source="T-PORT_NA030010.gif" alt="T-PORT_NA030010.gif"></graphic></p><p>The rationale for nesting clinical trial results for periodic reporting (as contrasted with immediate reporting of individual observations) are discussed in the Regulated Studies domain Introduction and Scope section above.  To achieve nesting in the CDISC laboratory model, the clinical trial is broken down into individual sites, and then into investigators at each site.  Subjects are identified for each investigator.  The next level represents the study events (often called visits) for a particular subject, and laboratory specimens collected during each study event are accessioned.  Diverging branches for representation of observations on different types of specimens (standard/base, microbiologic, genomic, ..) are anticipated, but the current message deals only with the base specimen type.  These specimens are subjected to test batteries, which in turn are headers for their respective tests and results.  The diagram above lists the data to be represented at each level of nesting. These data are defined in the published CDISC standard.</p><p>In addition to nested data, the business model requires the ability to specify transaction type (add, update, delete, no change) at each level of the hierarchy.  This business requirement allows the sender to indicate the action the receiver should take relative to specific (not necessarily all) data in the message. The transaction type applies at the level at which it is specified, and to all data below it in the message, unless the transaction type is respecified at that lower level.  Such overrides must follow the rules of logic.  For example, a <emph>delete</emph> at the subject level cannot be overridden by an <emph>add</emph> at the study event level, since there is no subject for which the study event can be added.  On the other hand, it is possible to specify an <emph>update</emph> of the Study Event (eg. new visit name), followed by an <emph>unchanged</emph> (previously sent) Accession with a <emph>new</emph>specimen for that Study Event. Individual transmission agreements may tighten these constraints (eg. to specify that once a transmission type has been set, it cannot be overridden at a lower level of nesting).</p><p>The <emph>update</emph> type transaction cannot change any required fields, since it relies on those fields to identify the object to be updated.  In addition, the <emph>delete</emph> transaction type applies to all data in the receivers posession that is logically below that level in the hierarchy - and which has been received from the sender.  Individual transmission agreements can specify whether or not the sender must include all lower-level data to be deleted.</p><p>If the <emph>delete</emph> is for the purpose of changing a required field, all of the lower level data that has been sent previously must be retransmitted as <emph>new</emph>, following transmission of the <emph>new</emph> data at the previously deleted level.</p></descriptive><diagref ref="PORT_ST030001UV01.gif"/><intref ref="PORT_IN030001UV01-int" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="CTLaboratory Periodic Report to Sponsor/Agent" refFamiliarName="CTLaboratory Periodic Report to Sponsor/Agent" refIdentifier="PORT_IN030001UV01" sequence="1"/></story></storydivn><approledivn identifier="roles-PORT_DO000001UV-Ctlaboratory" name="Application Roles" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Ctlaboratory-ic" id="roles-PORT_DO000001UV-Ctlaboratory-ic"><descriptive identifier="arop-PORT_DO000001UV-Ctlaboratory" name="Reference" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Ctlaboratory-ic" id="arop-PORT_DO000001UV-Ctlaboratory-ic"><p>For details on the interpretation of this section, see <xspecref spec="v3guide.htm" ref="v3gapprole" alt="the discussion of application roles"/> and their relationships in the Version 3 Guide.</p></descriptive><artree><artreeitem><arref role="included" ref="PORT_AR010001UV01-ar" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="CTLaboratory_04" refFamiliarName="ClinicalTrial Observation Event Global Tracker" refIdentifier="PORT_AR010001UV01"/></artreeitem><artreeitem><arref role="included" ref="PORT_AR010002UV01-ar" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="CTLaboratory_05" refFamiliarName="ClinicalTrial Observation Event Global Informer" refIdentifier="PORT_AR010002UV01"/><artreeitem><arref role="included" ref="PORT_AR020001UV01-ar" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="AnnotatedECG_06" refFamiliarName="AnnotatedECG Event Global Informer - CT" refIdentifier="PORT_AR020001UV01"/></artreeitem><artreeitem><arref role="included" ref="PORT_AR030001UV01-ar" sectID="hmport" sectType="SB" refName="CTLaboratory_06" refFamiliarName="CTLaboratory Observation Event Global Informer" refIdentifier="PORT_AR030001UV01"/></artreeitem></artreeitem></artree><approle identifier="PORT_AR010001UV01" name="CTLaboratory_04" familiarName="ClinicalTrial Observation Event Global Tracker" parent="PORT_DO000001UV-Ctlaboratory-ic" id="PORT_AR010001UV01-ar" sortPrefix="20|99|99|99|_04" baseClass="Ctlaboratory" ballotStatus="NormativeStandard" ballotNumber="1" hidden="no" lastEdit="2004-03-15T17:35:19"><descriptive identifier="desc-PORT_AR010001UV01" name="Description" parent="PORT_AR010001UV01-ar" id="desc-PORT_AR010001UV01-ar" lastEdit="2004-03-15T17:35:19"><p>The application role includes the behaviors needed to receive and appropriately manage notifications from another system about any state change of a Clinical Trial Observation Event.

None of the required data is captured in this act, but it serves to tie together the subject, study and visits.  The person who is the subject of the study is represented by the Person class, where the initials, sex, birthdate and race can be specified.  Codelists are included as components of the attributes capturing this information. This person participates in a particular SubjectAssignment through one of the two subject roles, EnrolledSubject or ScreeningSubject.  A third subject role -- SpareSubject -- is available but cannot be the sole identifier for the subject in the study.  A choice of identifier is made when a subject participates in a SubjectAssignment.  If the EnrolledSubject role is chosen, the ScreeningSubject identifier can be specified as well.  If the ScreeningSubject role is chosen, however, the EnrolledSubject identifier cannot be specified.  A second SubjectAssignment will advance the subject from screening to enrolled.</p><p><emph>Business Model Category: Study Event</emph></p><p>Study events are represented by the TimepointEvent class - a component of a  study assignment (i.e. as events that happen to a subject assigned to a specific investigator, site and trial).  Visit name and number from the business model are captured in the code attribute of the TimepointEvent  class; and visit type (scheduled, retest, etc.) in the reasonCode.</p><p><emph>Business Model Category: Accession</emph></p><p>Accession identifier and last active date are represented in the Accession class.  The responsible laboratory is the Laboratory that scopes the Agent who authors the Accession act.</p><p><emph>Business Model Category: Base Specimen</emph></p><p>The act of BaseSpecimenDefinition links the Accession to the BaseSpecimen itself.  Using the BaseSpecimenDefinition act as a component of the Accession act allows the identity of the trial, subject, visit, etc. to flow through automatically to the specimen, and also to the tests and results.  When extensions to the model are determined, there will be a choice of SpecimenDefinition acts at this point, allowing variants in the information represented depending on the type of testing to be performed.</p><p>The NaturalMaterial (capturing material code, codelist and name from the business model) plays the role of BaseSpecimen, which participates as the subject of the BaseSpecimenDefinition act.  The specimen id is in the role itself.  Collection start and end dates are captured in the separate SpecimenCollectionProcedure act, which produces the BaseSpecimen.  The SpecimenCollection act is in turn related to the ProtocolSpecimenCollection, which defines the planned specimen collection as an offset from a ReferenceEvent.  The offset (captured in the pauseQuantity) and the name of the ReferenceEvent (in the code attribute) provide the planned collection time information from the business model.</p><p>The date the specimen is received at the laboratory is captured as the activityTime attribute of the ContainerRegistration act.  Condition and comments are recorded in the SpecimenComment related to the BaseSpecimen.  Subjects's Age and Fasting Status are collected as information pertinent to the specimen collection act itself.</p><p><emph>Business Model Category: Base Battery</emph></p><p>The name and identifier for each battery performed will be captured in the BaseBattery component of BaseSpecimenDefinition.</p><p><emph>Business Model Categories: Base Test and Base Result</emph></p><p>Since the business model supports only a single result for each test performed, both of these model categories are represented by the RMIM class BaseUnitaryResult and its related classes.</p><p>The performing laboratory is designated as the Laboratory represented by the Agent who actually performs the test.  The identity of that Agent is not captured in this message.</p><p>The identifiers for the test to be performed are all captured in the code attribute, which has components (by virtue of its datatype) for specifying a test code, a code list for that test code, and any number of translations of that code into other coding systems.  Thus the data provider's code can be translated into the data recipient's code, and into the LOINC code all within this same attribute.  Each of these codes can also be accompanied by a display name.</p><p>Also included in the BaseUnitaryResult class are attributes for additional description of the test (text), the status of the test (statusCode), the start and end dates/times of the testing activity (activityTime), the blinded status of the test result (confidentialityCode), and the test type (reasonCode).</p><p>The act ReportToSite, of which the BaseUnitaryResult is the subject, documents the date/time and status of the act of reporting each result to the study site.</p><p>Test level comments are captured in the TestComment class as uncoded character strings.</p><p>Using the PQ datatype, with it's component PQR translations, the single attribute named "value" captures all representations of the actual test result.  The first (PQ) component is reserved for the result represented in the UCUM coding system for unit of measure (UOM).  Subsequent translation components using the PQR datatype will represent the result value as SI, conventional and reported, respectively.  Each PQR component contains within it components for representing the numeric value of the result, the unit of measure, the unit of measure coding system, and a textual representation of the result.  In xml, each result is specified as being of a particular xsitype, which will allow the specification of the Reported Result Type as Coded, Numeric, Text or Range.  The methodCode attribute of the BaseUnitaryResult will designate whether the Reported Result should be characterized as "greater than quantifiable limit" or "less that quantifiable limit" -- so the requirements for Reported Result Type are satisfied between these two mechanisms.</p><p>Reference range values for each result are captured in the ReferenceRange class, whose value attribute is structured as is the value attribute of the BaseUnitaryResult class.  In this case, each type of result (conventional, SI, reported) is expressed as an interval, rather than as a single value, giving the extremes of the range.</p><p>The alerts (alert flag, delta flag, exclusion flag), as well as interpretations not specified, are captured in the set of codes included in the interpretationCode of the BaseUnitaryResult.  A single toxicity grade is captured as a separate observation.</p><p><emph>Business Model Requirement: allow specification of transaction type (update, add, delete, no change) at every level of nesting</emph></p><p>This processing specification is handled in the HMD, rather than in the RMIM, and is displayed in the XL View of the HMD.  For each of the RMIM acts that represents a nested level of the hierarchy, a default update mode is specified in the HMD, along with the set of allowed update codes for that act.  Each Implementation Technology Specification (ITS) is expected to use the functionality available in that technology to validate each update mode specified at run-time, and to communicate that update mode.  Each implementation technology will handle the communication of update status differently, depending on the functionality available in the technology.</p><p><emph role="strong">CTLaboratory Observation RMIM as a Refinement of the Laboratory Domain DMIM</emph></p><p>(Note: the description here relates to the Laboratory Domain DMIM as published in HL7 Version3 Ballot Cycle #5 - July, 2003.  During that cycle, this specification passed membership-level ballot.   The comparison has not been updated since that time.)</p><p>This RMIM models both the information superstructure for representing the administrative aspects of a clinical trial (protocols, trials, sites, investigators, subjects and study events), and the information requirements for representing the laboratory observations generated during the conduct of a clinical trial.  These later requirements are substantially the same as those supported by the DMIM for the HL7 Laboratory domain, and the observation portion of the RMIM presented here can be substantially derived from that DMIM.  The link between the administrative model and the observation model occurs as the observation model class Accession is related to the administrative class StudyEvent.  To create the CTLaboratory Observation HMD, the resulting RMIM is traversed beginning in the administrative portion of the model, rather than at the individual observations.</p><p>The approach used for observations in the RMIM is to unroll the Observation class of the DMIM to three levels, constraining the DMIM ActRelationship sourceOf / targetOf to the typeCode COMP (component of) for each level.</p><p>The top level is the BaseSpecimenDefinition clone in the RMIM.  This level implements the componentOf relationship to the Accession class from the DMIM.  It also implements the DMIM's subject relationship to the Specimen.</p><p>The second level is the BaseBattery clone in the RMIM.</p><p>The third level -- the BaseUnitaryResult clone -- represents the individual observations, and implements the Performer and Pertinent Information relationships from the DMIM. This third level implements the sourceOf / targetOf relationship once more, with typeCode constrained to REFV (reference value) to capture the reference ranges for the individual observations.</p><p>The RecordTarget (Patient) relationship of the DMIM is represented in the administrative portion of the RMIM by the assignment of each study subject to a trial, trial site and investigator through the StudyAssignment act.  This StudyAssignment act inherits the trial and subject contexts, and  propagates them to the various levels of observation through the intervening component relationships.</p><p>The remaining Observation relationships in the DMIM are not implemented in the RMIM.  However, some additional relationships not supported by the DMIM are implemented in the RMIM.  These include: </p><list role="unordered"><item><p>the inclusion of information about other "reports" that have been made concerning the observation.  When reporting laboratory observations to a clinical trial sponsor, it is customary to include information on when the same observation was reported to the study site.</p></item><item><p>the specification of "update mode".  Pending HL7 resolution of how update mode will be handled generally in HL7 messages,  the Modeling and Methodology committee has approved the representation employed in the RMIM</p></item></list><p>The Specimen CMET as a whole was not incorporated into the RMIM, primarily due to that CMET's complexity, but also for reasons of certain incompatibilities between the CMET and the RMIM's business requirements.  Instead, portions of the CMET were directly replicated in the RMIM.

This is because the "text' attribute in Acts (shown in red on the diagram), and the "desc" attribute in Entities (shown in green on the diagram) can be valued with a URL which provides a link to additional documentation.  This additional documentation would either be provided along with the stability report, or would be stored at the sender's site at the location indicated by the URL.  </p><p>This discussion provides some discussion of the data structures within the model.  The review of individual classes is ordered by reference to the messaging entry point.  (The messaging entry point indicates the starting point for the message.

Defines the tests and test components that are to be performed.  Information collected directly about the test definition includes the test type, any relevant description, and the test method.  The same can be said regarding the information to be collected for a test component.
<p>The associations of this class indicate that:</p><p>a) an observation may contain component observations,</p><p>b) that performed observations (test results) are evaluated by reference to defined acceptance criteria,</p><p>c) that a test definition is associated with the tests that are performed.</p><p>Note that a test definition can have zero to many components, and be associated with zero to many acceptance criteria.  It is also true, although the multiplicity is not directly documented, that a test definition can be associated with zero to many tests (performed tests).</p></item><item><emph>AcceptanceCriterion:</emph>
Defines the limits within which performed observations are interpreted.  Information collected directly about the acceptance criterion include the criterion type, the actual criterion value, an indicator showing whether the criterion or its inverse is to be applied, and descriptive text.</item><item><emph>StudyOnBatch:</emph>
Indicates the collection of observations (results) that are performed on samples from a single batch.  In formation collected directly about the study on batch includes a study type and an identifier.
<p>The associations of this class indicate:</p><p>a) the stability study that this study on batch is a component of,</p><p>b) the product instance that samples are drawn from,</p><p>c) the collection of storage and testing time points that make up the study on batch.</p><p>Note that a study on batch is related to a single stability study, a single instance of material, and can be related to many testing and storage time points.  (There will be a single storage time point that indicates when samples are placed in storage, and generally multiple testing time points - one for each pull of samples from storage.)</p></item><item><emph>Instance(Manufactured Material):</emph>
The role of instance is played by manufactured material.  This is some amount of product or substance drawn from a specific manufactured or formulated batch.  As with test definition, the same class is used to define the information captured about the material tested and ingredients that it is made up of.  Information collected includes the amount of material provided for testing, descriptive text, the production date, expiration date, and batch lot number.
<p>The associations of the role and playing entity indicate:</p><p>a) the product or substance the batch is an instance of,</p><p>b) the study on batch that uses samples from this batch,</p><p>c) the ingredients that the product contains (Note that the BatchIngredient role class creates a recursive association.  Therefore, it is possible to value the same data and associations for an ingredient of a product as for the product itself.),</p><p>d) the manufacturer of the batch,</p><p>e) the container used to contain the product.</p><p>Note that the manufactured material instance, is an instance of a single product or substance, is used in a single study on batch, is produced by a single manufacturer, is stored in a single type of container, and contains one to many ingredients.  A manufactured material in the role of ingredient is used in one and only one product (within the context of this model).</p></item><item><emph>Manufacturer:</emph>
This role and scoping organization indicates the manufacturer of the product.  Information collected includes the manufacturer name, an identifier, and an address.
<p>The association of the organization indicates that the manufacturing site for a product, can be carrying out that work as an assignee of another organization - the scoping organization.</p><p>Note that the manufacturing site can be carrying out the work as the assignee of zero to many scoping organizations.</p></item><item><emph>Container:</emph>
This role and scoping entity, indicate the container and within which the product is to be delivered, and within which samples for study will be contained.  Information collected about the container includes the container type, descriptive text, the container lot number, the capacity of the container, and the cap (closure system) type.  The actual quantity in the container is also captured as an attribute of the content role.</item><item><emph>(TimePoint)Storage:</emph>
This class collects the storage conditions are applicable to the testing done on the samples drawn from a batch.  Information collected about storage includes the storage type, descriptive text, and the effective date on which the sample was placed into storage.
<p>The associations of the storage act indicate:</p><p>a) the study on batch related to the storage,</p><p>b) the storage conditions that define the way the sample is stored.</p><p>Note that a storage act is associated with a single study on batch, and with one to many storage conditions.</p></item><item><emph>StorageCondition:</emph>
A storage condition should be considered as an intervention applied to a collection of samples. Each condition indicates a single parameter of storage, e.g, temperature, humidity, the orientation of the product container.  Information collected about the storage condition includes the condition type, descriptive text, and the condition value.</item><item><emph>(TimePoint)Testing:</emph>
This class indicates the particular time point at which a sample is drawn from storage so that tests may be performed on in or on portions of the sample.  Information collected about the testing act include the testing type, a title that labels the collection of related tests, descriptive text, and the effective date on which samples were drawn.  Note, component pause quantity indicates the sampling time point, e.g, three months, associated with the testing.
<p>The associations of the testing act indicate:</p><p>a) the study on batch related to the testing,</p><p>b) the collection of observations that are performed on the sample or samples drawn at a particular testing time point.</p><p>Note that a testing act is associated with a single study on batch, and with one to many tests.</p></item><item><emph>Test:</emph>
This class indicates the performance of a test on a sample drawn from storage at a particular time point. Information collected about the test include descriptive text, the specific time at which the test was performed, and the test result (value) 
<p>The associations of observation indicate:</p><p>a) the observation definition for the observation (test, result) being performed,</p><p>b) the testing point in time at which the sample is drawn from storage, </p><p>c) whether component test instances are performed at particular points in time - indicated by pause quantity - after being drawn from storage, </p><p>d) the organization (location) performing the test.</p><p>Note that a test has a single definition, is performed on a sample drawn from storage at a single point in time, and is performed at a single test site.  A test may have multiple test components.</p></item><item>AssignedEntity(TestingSite)
The testing site entity makes it possible to indicate the particular site at which the test took place.</item></list></descriptive><diagref ref="PORT_RM090001UV.gif"/><hmdref role="containedHMD"
