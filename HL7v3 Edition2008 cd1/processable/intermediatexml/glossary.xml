                     <p>A Billing Account is an accumulator of financial and administrative information for the main purpose of supporting claims and reimbursement.  Secondarily, the billing account may contribute significant information to cost accounting and financial decision support systems.  A billing account is simply that entity that captures the elements reflecting the cost and price of services provided and supplies consumed for a healthcare activity.  The focus for which an account accumulates information will vary.  (For example: In a realm where billing is based on periodically collecting financial transactions for a patient, the accumulator might be the patient.)  A billing account might also include links to insurance and benefit information, and relevant responsible parties.</p>

                        <item>Health Status - the state of health
            of a specified individual, group, or population. It may be measured
            by obtaining proxies such as people's subjective assessments of their
            health; by one or more indicators of mortality and morbidity in the
            population, such as longevity or maternal and infant mortality; or
            by using the incidence or prevalence of major diseases (communicable,

            medical care system, although attempts to relate effects of available

                     <p>Concepts in this hierarchy represent a question about something which may be observed or measure. An observable entity combined with a result, constitutes a finding. 
For instance, the concept Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (observable entity) in effect represent the question &#8220;What is the value of the left ventricular end diastolic pressure?&#8221;

                     <p>An Act of recognizing and noting information about the subject, and whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is new data about a subject. Observations often involve measurement or other elaborate methods of investigation, but may also be simply assertive statements.</p>
                     <p>

Discussion: Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a &#8220;variable&#8221; (a named feature that can assume a value); hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.
As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (&#8220;results&#8221; or &#8220;answers&#8221;); and those &#8220;results&#8221; or &#8220;answers&#8221; are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. </p>
                     <p>
Note: This definition refers to the action rather than the outcome of the observation but in the discussion continues to refer to the &#8220;results&#8221; or &#8220;answers&#8221; as being a part of the observation. The general idea of an HL7 Observation therefore includes three distinct types of concept from a SNOMED CT perspection &#8220;Observable entities&#8221; (things that can be measured), &#8220;Measurement procedures&#8221; (a type of procedure used to make a measurement or observation) and &#8220;Clinical finding&#8221; (expressing both the name of the observation and its value). </p>

            events occurring from drug overdose, whether accidental or intentional,
            drug abuse, drug withdrawal, and significant failure of expected
            pharmacological action.  A proven cause-and-effect relationship between
            the reaction and suspected drug(s) is not required before a reaction
            is reportable; reasonable suspicion is sufficient.  Blood products
            are specifically excluded from adverse drug event monitoring and
            should be reported utilizing reporting mechanisms specifically designed

                     <p>
A combination of concept identifiers used to represent a single clinical idea is referred to as a post-coordinated expression (see expression). Many clinical ideas can also be represented using a single SNOMED CT concept identifier (see pre-coordination). </p>
                     <p>
Some clinical ideas may be represented in several different ways. SNOMED CT technical specifications include guidance of logical transformations that reduce equivalent expressions to a common canonical form.</p>
                     <p>
Example: SNOMED CT includes the following concepts:
Fracture of bone (conceptId= 125605004)<br/>
Finding site (conceptId= 363698007)<br/>
Bone structure of femur (conceptId= 181255000)<br/>
SNOMED CT also includes a pre-coordinated concept for this procedure<br/>
Fracture of femur (conceptId= 71620000)<br/>
                     </p>
                     <p>
It is possible to represent &#8220;fracture of femur&#8221; in different ways:
71620000 (pre-coordinated expression)
125605004 : 363698007 = 181255000 (post-coordinated expression).
</p>
                     <p>
Note: In an HL7 representation a SNOMED CT expression is represented in a single HL7 attribute using the HL7 CD (Concept Descriptor) data type.

A single concept identifier used to represent a specific meaning is referred to as a pre-coordinated expression (see expression). SNOMED CT also allows the use of post-coordinated expressions (see post-coordination) to represent a meaning using a combination of two or more concept identifiers. </p>

However, including commonly used concepts in a pre-coordinated form makes the terminology easier to use.</p>

Discussion: Applied to clinical medicine, procedure is but one among several types of clinical activities such as observation, substance-administrations, and communicative interactions (e.g. teaching, advice, psychotherapy, represented simply as Acts without special attributes). Procedure does not subsume those other activities nor is procedure subsumed by them. Notably Procedure does not comprise all acts of whose intent is intervention or treatment. Whether the bodily alteration is appreciated or intended as beneficial to the subject is likewise irrelevant, what counts is that the act is essentially an alteration of the physical condition of the subject.</p>
                     <p>
Note: This definition and the associated discussion exclude many activities which are subsumed by the more general sense of the word &#8220;procedure&#8221; which is used in the SNOMED CT definition.

                     <p>The rhythm waveforms are encoded as an Observation Series in HL7.  The series contains one or more Correlated Observation Sequences ("correlation" for short).  Each correlation encodes the leads that were sampled together and correlated with the same relative time points. If all 12 leads were sampled together (assuming a 12-lead ECG), only one correlation is required.  This correlation would contain a sequence for relative time and 12 sequences for the 12 different leads.  If time was evenly sampled (as it usually is), a GLIST&lt;&gt; is used for generating the sequence of time points from a few parameters.  The lead sequences would use the SLIST&lt;&gt; for encoding the voltages.  The SLIST&lt;&gt; can factor out a common offset and scale factor (if the raw integer A/D values encoded).  The offset and scale factor can be used for converting the stored values to real physical quantities. If a 12-lead ECG is recorded on a device that only samples 3 leads at a time, for example, the Observation Series would contain 4 correlations.  Each correlation would encode the leads that were sampled together.  Each correlation would contain one sequence for time relative to the beginning of the recording, and 3 sequences for the 3 leads sampled.  If the device has a few more channels and records one or more rhythm leads during the whole recording, the rhythm leads would appear in each correlation as well.</p>
