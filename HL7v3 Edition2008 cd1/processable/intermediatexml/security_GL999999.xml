            medications.  The medication bar code, patient wristband, and the
            provider bar are used to uniquely identify each administration of
            a medication in the hospital and nursing home settings.  Medications
            are provided in unit doses for each patient and stored in a cart

            for administration.  For each dosage, the electronic medication administration
            record is used and the codes read for the medication, the patient,
            and the person administering it.  Any conflicts between medication
            or dosage and patient are noted electronically, and the medication
            administration is ceased until resolved.  Missed doses and refusals
            are recorded electronically in the electronic record, and all documentation
            of administration is electronic.  Controlled substances also are
        signed out electronically.</p>

					<label>Patient Allergies</label>
					<def domainid="security_glossary">
						<p>A misguided reaction to foreign substances
            by the immune system, the body system of defense against foreign
            invaders, particularly pathogens (the agents of infection).  The
            allergic reaction is misguided in that these foreign substances are
            usually harmless.  The substances that trigger allergy are called
            allergen.  Examples include pollens, dust mite, molds, danders, and
            certain foods.  People prone to allergies are said to be allergic
        or atopic.</p>

					<label>Patient Allergy or Adverse Reaction</label>
					<def domainid="security_glossary">
						<p>Untoward noxious reaction associated with
            drug use.  It may result from administration of over-the-counter,
            prescription, or investigational/research drugs.  It includes adverse
            events occurring from drug overdose, whether accidental or intentional,
            drug abuse, drug withdrawal, and significant failure of expected
            pharmacological action.  A proven cause-and-effect relationship between
            the reaction and suspected drug(s) is not required before a reaction
            is reportable; reasonable suspicion is sufficient.  Blood products
            are specifically excluded from adverse drug event monitoring and
            should be reported utilizing reporting mechanisms specifically designed
            for these products.  An allergy is an adverse reaction mediated
        by an immunologic mechanism.</p>
