Domain spans a variety of clinical-administrative information functions associated with the organizations, individuals, animals and devices involved in the delivery and support of healthcare services.    The domain content includes roles, relationships, credentials, certificates, licenses, capacities, capabilities, competencies, qualifications, privileges, responsibilities, and assignments issued to or managed by the involved organizations, individuals, animals and devices.  </p><p>The PM Domain assumes the responsibility for communicating specific data associated with the domain content including status, coded names, demographic details, participating parties, activation and termination dates, and associated supporting documentation.</p><p><emph role="strong">Introduction</emph></p><p>The Personnel Management Domain is organized into four Topic Areas; 
 <xspecref spec="UVPM" ref="HumanResource" alt="Provider (Registry)"></xspecref>, and  <xspecref spec="UVPM" ref="HumanResource" alt="Organization (Registry)"></xspecref>.  
	
The Human Resources (HR) and Regulatory (both clinical and administrative) topics differ fundamentally in the amount of detail exposed relative to a given context relationship.  As a consequence, the PM Domain's messages support a range of detail, from basic existence (e.g., a provider is recognized by an organization) to highly detailed (e.g., credentialing management).</p><p><emph role="strong">The Personnel Management Domain Analysis Model</emph></p><p>The following Domain Analysis Model (DAM) was developed by the personnel management committee as part of the exercise of modeling the business of Personnel Management. This same business information is in turn reflected in the Domain Information Model (DMIM), where needed to fulfill messaging requirements.  The purpose of the DAM is to show the relationships between the significant classes in the domain and the key attributes of interest within each class. </p><emph>Concept Description</emph><p>Within the PM Domain, the term credential is defined as a token representing (or containing) the collection of data that attests to the existence of a Relationship involving two and only two parties, the Commissioning Party and the Responsible Party.   As defined, a credential can be a certificate, a license, a diploma, a written verification of work experience, or other token issued by the Commissioning Party as a statement of the Responsible Party's competency, capability, or capacity.</p><p>In the HL7 RIM this kind of relationship is expressed as a Role wherein  the Commissioning Party is referred to as the Scoper (Scoping Entity) and the Responsible Party is referred to as the Player (Playing Entity). A Role is assumed by the Player (usually for a finite period of time) in the context of some sort of oversight by the Scoper.  The Role may exist independently from the existence of a Credential (or Credentials); however, if Credential(s) exists they are regarded as a description or attribute of the Role.</p><p>Thus, within this framework, the term 'credential' can be used to attest to the existence of relationships (Roles) in any number of contexts and degrees of formality. This includes the processes associated with, and connotations applied to, the terms license, certificate, education, work experience, capability, capacity, competency, qualification, etc.</p><p><emph>Example:</emph>  The Jurisdictional Medical Board defines the set of competencies and time constraints associated with the role of "Licensed Physician".  The Board assigns this role to a specific person thus establishing a "Licensed Physician" relationship with that person and subsequently issues a license as evidence of the relationship.    Thus the Role and the Relationship defining it are synonymous. The HL7 RIM represents the Medical Board as the Scoping Entity (Organization), Licensed Physician as the Role and the designated person as the Playing Entity (Person). </p><p>Following is a full walkthrough of the DAM diagram. <diagref ref="T-PRPM_NA000001.gif"></diagref></p><p><emph role="strong">Domain Analysis Walkthrough</emph></p><p>The Personnel Management Domain Analysis Model (DAM) represents the central concepts, attributes, and relationships that define the domain(s)-of-interest of the Personnel Management Technical Committee (PM TC) using the iconography of UML class diagrams.  The development of a DAM for a given domain is described in the Requirements and Analysis chapter of the Health Development Framework (HDF) process being developed by HL7. 
</p><p>An initial version of the PM DAM was built over the course of two Working Group meetings in 2003 using input from a variety of domain experts from Human Relations (HR), regulatory agencies, and US Department of Defense Credential and Credential/Privilege Management.  It has subsequently been (and will continue to be) expanded/more finely granulated based on ongoing discussions with numerous domain experts including those working on specific projects such as Provider Registries, Credentialing and Privileging Systems, etc.</p><p>The DAM intentionally utilizes 'non-RIM-speak' (i.e. terms familiar to domain experts but not necessarily used in the RIM) to capture the essential concepts, attributes, and relationships of the domain in 'domain-friendly' terms.  In the best-of-all-possible worlds, the DAM would reach a fairly mature state before it would be utilized as a guide to construct a semantically equivalent PM DMIM.  In fact, the PM TC had an existing DMIM before they committed to adopting the HDF and, as a consequence, building a DAM.  As such, the DAM is being simultaneously developed in both a forward (DAM -&gt; DMIM) and backward (DMIM -&gt; DAM) direction.</p><p>A listing of the Domain Analysis Classes is included below to provide a glossary critical to the successful understanding of the mapping between the DAM and DMIM that explains the semantic equivalence between the two representations.</p><p>The central conceptual idea represented in the PM DAM is that of an instance of an <emph role="strong">Entity</emph> playing/assuming a <emph role="strong">Role</emph>. Note that <emph role="strong">Entity</emph> is an abstract concept, i.e. there are no instances of the <emph role="strong">Entity</emph> concept, but instead instances of the various subtypes of <emph role="strong">Entity</emph>, i.e. <emph role="strong">Place</emph>, <emph role="strong">Organization</emph>, <emph role="strong">Device</emph>, and <emph role="strong">Living Subject</emph> (which, in turn has subtypes of <emph role="strong">Person</emph> and <emph role="strong">Animal</emph>).
</p><p>A specific <emph role="strong">Role</emph> may require certain <emph role="strong">Qualifications</emph> (which may be bundled together in complex collections whose semantics are specified by instances of <emph role="strong">Qualification Relationship</emph>) of the <emph role="strong">Entity</emph> subtype instance playing the <emph role="strong">Role</emph>.  The specific <emph role="strong">Qualification</emph> of the 'playing' <emph role="strong">Entity</emph> instance may be validated by the 'assigning' <emph role="strong">Entity</emph> instance by one or more <emph role="strong">Credential</emph> instances issued to the playing <emph role="strong">Entity</emph>.  <emph><emph role="strong">Credential</emph> is modeled as a specialization of the concept of <emph role="strong">Qualification</emph> to distinguish that a <emph role="strong">Qualification</emph> is simply an assertion, whereas a <emph role="strong">Credential</emph> involves two Parties: a Responsible Party (the receiver of the credential) and a Commissioning Party (the issuer of the credential</emph>).  <emph>These two concepts are currently not shown in the DAM but are conceptually represented in the PM DMIM by the relationships of Player and Scoper.</emph>  Note that if a specific <emph role="strong">Credential</emph> is required for a particular <emph role="strong">Role</emph>, the scoping <emph role="strong">Entity</emph> (or other person or organization) may choose to validate the existence of the credential for the specific player <emph role="strong">Entity</emph>, capturing the details of this validation process in a <emph role="strong">Certificate of Verification</emph>.</p><p>An instance of an <emph role="strong">Entity</emph>-in-a-<emph role="strong">Role</emph> may apply for or be assigned to a <emph role="strong">Position</emph>, an action that is documented using an instance of the <emph role="strong">Application or Assignment</emph> class.  <emph>Subsequent analysis as to the attributes of this class may dictate that it be split into two separate classes.</emph>  A <emph role="strong">Position</emph> may be associated with one or more instances of the <emph role="strong">Responsibility</emph> class.  Similar to the relationship between <emph role="strong">Qualification</emph> and <emph role="strong">Credential</emph>, the concept <emph role="strong">Responsibility</emph> is subtyped to <emph role="strong">Privilege</emph>, a type of <emph role="strong">Responsibility</emph> with a higher degree of formality in that it involves a 'contract' between the Privilege Grantor and the Privilege Recipient (concepts not currently shown in the DAM but similar DMIM concepts of Player and Scoper as discussed above).  <emph>The DAM does NOT show that a <emph role="strong">Privilege</emph> may be granted to a <emph role="strong">Entity</emph>-in-a-<emph role="strong">Role</emph> in the absence of a formal assignment to a Position although this business process is often supported.  This additional association is not shown because the details of any differences in messages required to support this concept are as yet unknown and uncertain</emph>.  Finally, note that a <emph role="strong">Position</emph> may be associated with a complex set of <emph role="strong">Criterion</emph> instances which specify the set of <emph role="strong">Qualification</emph> and/or <emph role="strong">Credential</emph> instances and their inter-relationships in the context of a specific <emph role="strong">Position</emph>.  The <emph role="strong">Criterion</emph> class has been subtyped to <emph role="strong">Time-Based Criterion</emph> and <emph role="strong">Non-Time-Based Criterion</emph> based on domain expert input.  However, to date, little analysis has been done with respect to these concepts.</p><p><emph role="strong">Domain Analysis Classes (Glossary)</emph></p><p>The purpose of this Glossary of the Domain Analysis Model (DAM) Classes is to define the various concepts and attributes identified in the DAM and not, per se, to express the semantics of the DAM in terms of the RIM or its various derived artifacts. In particular, the final semantics of such mappings, although variously indicated or implied in the Glossary definitions and/or examples, may not be ultimately specified and/or unambiguously defined until the concept/attribute is included in one of the various 'down-stream' RIM-based artifacts (e.g. DMIM, RMIM, CMET, etc.) </p><p>NOTE:  For attributes of each of the DAM concepts (classes), the current DAM has not made any attempt to rigorously specify either the type or the multiplicity of an attribute.  Such specifications obviously become critical during the construction of the semantically equivalent (or nearly equivalent) DMIM and/or in the mapping of specific DAM concepts/attributes/relationships to the PM DMIM</p><p><emph role="strong">Entity</emph>: A thing (or group of things) of interest in the PM Domain.

A statement of a specific capability, competency, and/or capacity which may either be asserted by, or required for, a Role or Assignment or Application for a Position.

A Position may exist without a Person in a Role being Assigned to that Position, i.e. a Position can be created/defined in terms of the Qualifications (including various forms of Credentials that a Person must have to qualify for an Assignment to that Position). A Position is considered to be dependent on the existence of a Role because of the common domain perspective that a 'base' or 'functional' role (e.g. Staff Physician) is often necessary before the (e.g. person) in a given 'base/functional' role can be assigned to other roles (e.g. Chair of Department of Cardiology, Director of ICU, etc.).

An activity for which the Responsible Party is required to do to the satisfaction, under the jurisdiction of, as an agent for the Commissioning Party.

Example:  contains, &lt;rule/predicate&gt;</item></list><p><emph role="strong">Criterion</emph>: A rule which defines the manner in which a particular Qualification (including a Credential) or collections of Qualifications are associated with a given Position. An instance of a Criterion may be either a Time-based Criterion (e.g. &lt;xxx&gt; for at least 3 years) or a Non-time-based Criterion (e.g. certified as either an &lt;x&gt; or a &lt;y&gt;). 
</p><p><emph role="strong">Time-based Criterion</emph>: A rule with one or more time-based input parameters/attribute descriptors, e.g. if more than 3-days, after 20 minutes, etc.
</p><p><emph role="strong">Non-time-based Criterion</emph>: A rule for which input parameters/attribute descriptors are not time-based, e.g. if X = 3, if either A or B, etc.
</p><p><emph role="strong">Criterion Relationship</emph>: The concept used to link related instances of Criterion
</p><list role="unordered"><item><emph role="strong">Criterion Relationship.Type: </emph>A code denoting the semantics of the linkage between two Criterion instances.  Example:  contains, alternative to.</item></list><p><emph role="strong">Privilege</emph>: A subtype of Responsibility that is differentiated by virtue of the fact that it is associated with specific instances of Credential rather than instances of Qualification. Although a Privilege may be associated with a Position (e.g. the Position of Attending Physician may be associated with Admitting Privileges), a Person in a Role may, in addition, apply for other Privileges outside the context of a named Role. Each application involves at least one other Party who must review the Person-in-a-Role's specific Credentials required in order for the Privilege to be granted. Requirements may be defined by the Granting Party and/or by external organizations. NOTE: A Privilege differs from a Responsibility in that the association/assignment of a Privilege to a Person-in-a-Role requires the interaction of at least two instances of Party, i.e. the Person-in-a-Role (who may or may not be in a Position) requesting the Privilege and the Person/Organization-in-a-Role granting the Privilege. In the sense that it requires a 2-Party interaction,' the concept Privilege is therefore similar to Credential.

The RMIMs for staffing and assignment messages constrain the entry point to one of two focal classes, either AssignedEntity or Employee.  The playing Entity for either role supports different kinds of demographic information depending upon whether the subject is a person, organization or animal.   </p><p>The focal role is scoped by an Organization entity that in turn plays the role of a Commissioning Party responsible for creation and promulgation of the particular focal Role (e.g. an organization that defines a functional role to which a person is assigned). A standard set of scoper demographics are supported; with the exception of scoper for the Citizen role and for Member role, which have unique requirements.   </p><p>Interactions for managing personnel records, and for some types of registry operations, often encompass a broad spectrum of information about a person.  A playing entity may have a multitude of concurrent roles, in addition to the focal one of Employee and/or AssignedEntity.  These concurrent roles are 'bound together' via a RoleLink class (relatedTo) that can be seen on the model on the far right of the RoleChoice box. When serialized for a message the model permits multiple walks from the focal role to other related roles for the same playing entity as: an AssignedEntity (functional role in an organization), QualifiedEntity (education &amp; training), HealthCareProvider (licensed practitioner), OtherLicencedEntity (licensed roles other than Provider), Employee (HR classification for payroll / remuneration purposes), Citizen or Member (of a resource group).   </p><p>An example: an employed physician may hold multiple qualifications (QualifiedEntity roles), some relating to his licensed role of HealthCareProvider and some to his Employee or AssignedEntity roles. The rolelink supports differential association of these roles by binding together those that are dependent.   </p><p>The current model supports only a limited set of attributes for the aforementioned Roles, their scoping entities, and the subject player. However, the list of supported attributes is increasing with each ballot cycle, as more use cases are incorporated into the domain model. Details about all of the classes can be found in the alphabetical listing at the end of this section. However, two attributes worth particular mention are present on almost all the focal roles: Role.statuscode, for communicating state changes, and Role.CertificateText to support the exchange of human readable certificates (e.g., an image of a License) or fully encoded (machine processable) certificates.  (A computable form of certification data is supported elsewhere in the model, in the Vetting act).      </p><p><emph>Verification Interactions</emph></p><p>Although still in development this model is intended to support interactions for ordering and resulting of credential verification activities. Roles represent a credentialed relationship between the scoper and player and the intent of these interactions is to ascertain the veracity of (usually) the player's claim to the competency embodied in that role.   </p><p>Entry point to the model is through the VerificationRequest and thereafter to the multiple Verification acts by which the request is fulfilled. A verification request is placed in Order mood, and responded to in Promise and Event (fulfillment) moods.   </p><p>Three participations are supported for the Verification events: the Subject of the activity, identified as one of the focal Roles within the role choice box; the PrimaryPerformer that carries out the verification activity, acting as an agent of a credential verification organization; and one or more Informants that substantiate the asserted competency. Informants are TrustedSource agents of either the organization that scopes the subject role or of a separate agency (e.g., a Practitioner Data Bank) that supplies evidentiary data.   </p><p>The model also supports the description of Documentation (the Document act) pertinent to the individual Verification acts.   </p><p><emph>Regulatory (Role Activation) Interactions</emph></p><p>Although still in development this model is intended to support interactions between regulatory agencies that scope roles (define and manage them) and organizations that are consumers of such information. Entry point to the model is through a focal role (in the RoleChoice box) with a walk through the subject participation to the RoleActivation control act. The latter communicates pertinent details about the regulatory activities, including state transitions of roles. Two participations are supported: the subject role, as already noted, and the author (CommissioningParty).   </p><p>The author participation supports detailed information about the scoping organization in its role as the creator/manager of the Role. In both the DMIM and DAM this role is known as that of CommissioningParty. </p><p>The RoleActivation trigger event is linked to (is the outcome of) observations that precede the activation of a role. This is the Vetting act, which in this model is a 'collector' of observations: it supports communications about a person's/organization's capabilities, competencies, capacities and etc. Details are encapsulated in the .value attribute of the Act. Vetting activities may include acquiring information from external regulatory bodies. For example, the CommissioningParty is a State Licensing Board which has had the education qualifications of an applicant verified before issuing a license (a role activation) to practice as a HealthCare Provider.) To support the description of these inputs the Vetting act has a 'pertains' relationship to the Verification act and its associated classes.   </p><p>Regulatory agencies are also sources of credentials and a CredentialSupplyEvent act is included in the model to communicate the issuing of certificates. This Act captures the details of the issuance of a physical or virtual token that attests to Activation of a Role. For example, a diploma (or copy thereof) attesting to the completion of university studies may be issued to a qualified recipient any number of times as requested. This Act is distinct from the original Vetting act or Role Activation.   </p><p><emph>Provider Registry Interactions  </emph></p><p>Entry point to the model is through the HealthCareProvider role, which is the focal class for interactions related to Provider Registry messages.  Registry interactions use many portions of the model described in the earlier sections.  Readers should refer to the class descriptions below as well the RMIMs in the Provider Topic.  </p><p>O<emph>rganization Registry Interactions  </emph></p><p>Entry point to the model is through the AssignedEntityRole role, which is the focal class for interactions related to Organization Registry messages.  The player of this role is restricted to a PrincipalOrganization, but otherwise uses many of the same model components as the Provider Registry messages.  Readers should refer to the class descriptions below as well the RMIMs in the Organization Topic.  </p><p><emph>Responsibilities &amp; Privileges</emph></p><p>The committee has started work on describing privileges (See Privilege and PrivilegeCategorization class descriptions) and will expand the model in future releases.  Structures to support the description and verification of Responsibilities are planned fora future version of the DMIM. </p><emph role="strong">Alphabetical Class Listing</emph><p>Classes from the DMIM are listed alphabetically within each type (Act, Entity, Role and Other - including Role Link). Associative classes (Participation, Act Relationship) are described in the context of their source and/or target and not listed separately.   </p><p><emph>Attribute comments </emph>have been included with each class description where the committee wished to supply additional clarification and/or usage notes on how the object was being employed in the domain model.

</p><p>Distributions are managed within the registry by subscriber distribution profiles that define the message content.

messaging necessary to report that a new record was added, or should be added, to a provider registry system. </p><p>
Th<emph role="strong">e Add Provider R-MIM</emph> is derived from the <emph role="strong">Personnel Management D-MIM</emph> (<artref ref="PRPM_DM000000" alt="PRPM_DM000000"></artref>); please refer to the documentation of the D-MIM for a detailed walkthrough of the diagram.   Following are highlights of the R-MIM and notes of changes or constraints that have been placed on the D-MIM model for this R-MIM.  
</p><p>The entry point to this RMIM is to the RoleChoice box with an additional constraint that messages must start with the HealthCareProvider Role.   
</p><p>From the RIM definition, an assigned role is an agent role in which the agent is an Entity acting in the employ of an organization. The focus of this RMIM is on the functional role performed by the provider on behalf of an organization, unlike the Employee role where the focus is on the 'Human Resources' relationship between the employee and the organization. For more information on the Human Resources model please refer to the Human Resource Topic Area within the Personnel Management domain.  
</p><p>The following specific notes apply to the classes in the R-MIM:  
</p><list role="unordered"><item>PrinicipalPerson (entity): Identification of playing entity is optional (0..1) to supports the case in which information directly related to the playing party is not needed.    
</item><item>AssignedEntity (role): The role class, assigned entity, captures the critical information of the provider playing the role of interest. This includes an identifier for the role, mailing address, phone number, and the time within which the role is played (may be open ended). The scooping organization, which may be omitted if not needed, provides the organizational context for the entity that actually plays the role. For example, the role scoper will normally be the party that assigns the identifier for the role.   
</item><item>QualifiedEntity (role): This role describes specific qualifications that may be held the provider as a result of training or experience, but having no legal force. Example: a medical degree or diploma.     The current model does not include role attributes such as name, addr and telecom because there are no known use cases in this domain where this role is 'contactable'.  
</item><item>HealthCareProvider (role):   This roles the specific Healthcare provider role such as a Physician, Nurse or other type of caregivers.   
</item><item>LanguageCommunication: This class models the language information for the subject provider.</item></list><p>The following constraints have been placed on the original D-MIM in the formation of this R-MIM:  </p><list role="unordered"><item>ActDefinitionOrEvent: effective time constrained from GTS to TS;  moodCode constrained to DEF. </item><item>Affiliate:  effectiveTime and code constrained from 0..1 to 1..1    </item><item>Birthplace:  class occurrences constrained from 0..* to 0..1;   addr constrained from BAG&lt;AD&gt; to AD </item><item>DisiplinaryAction:  confidentiality constrained from SET&lt;CE&gt; 0..* to CE 0..1   </item><item>InformDefintion:  negationInd and effectiveTime constrained from 0..1 to 1..1; effectiveTime constrained from GTS to TS   </item><item>InformRequest.Subject: moodCode constrained from 0..1 to 1..1  </item><item>InformRequest:  code constrained from 0..1 to 1..1  </item><item>Jurisdiction:  code constrained from 0..1 to 1..1  </item><item>LanguageCommunication:  languageCode constrained from optional to mandatory.  </item><item>Note:  text and effectiveTime constrained to 1..1 Place: name constrained from BAG&lt;EN&gt; 0..1 to EN 1..1   </item><item>PrincipalPerson:  name constrained from BAG to LIST; birthTime and administrativeGender constrained from 0..1 to 1..1  </item><item>Privilege: effective time constrained from 0..1 to 1..1 </item><item>PrivilegeCategorization:  code and value constrained from 0..1 to 1..1   </item><item>QualifiedEntity:  effectiveTime and code constrained from 0..1 to 1..1 </item><item>RoleActivation: moodCode constrained to EVN  </item><item>ServiceDeliveryLocation:  code constrained from 0..* to 0..1</item><item>SubjectOf2: Blocked path from Act to Role. </item><item>TerritorialAuthority:  code constrained from 0..1 to 1..1 </item></list><list role="unordered"><item>Audit enabled on all Addr and Telecom attributes throughout the R-MIM.</item></list></descriptive><rmimref role="parent" ref="PRPM_DM000000UV-rmi" sectID="amprpm" sectType="SB" refName="Personnel Management Domain Information Model" refFamiliarName="Personnel Management Domain Information Model" refIdentifier="PRPM_DO000000UV"/><diagref ref="PRPM_RM301000UV.gif"/><hmdref role="containedHMD" ref="PRPM_HD301010UV01-hmd" sectID="amprpm" sectType="SB" refName="Provider Event Create" refFamiliarName="Add Provider" refIdentifier="PRPM_HD301010UV01"/></rmim><rmim identifier="PRPM_RM303000UV01" name="Provider Event Revise" familiarName="Update Provider" parent="PRPM_DO000000UV-Provider-ic" id="PRPM_RM303000UV01-rmi" sortPrefix="03|20|22|" baseClass="Provider" ballotStatus="NormativeStandard" ballotNumber="1" class="changed" lastEdit="2008-06-05T14:55:57"><descriptive identifier="desc-PRPM_RM303000UV01" name="Description" parent="PRPM_RM303000UV01-rmi" id="desc-PRPM_RM303000UV01-rmi" lastEdit="2008-06-05T14:55:57"><p>The <emph role="strong">Update Provider R-MIM</emph> specifies the information model required to support messaging necessary to report that a record was updated, or should be updated, within a provider registry system.</p><p>Except where noted below, the constraint and usage notes for the R-MIM are the same as described in the <emph role="strong">Add Provider </emph>(<artref alt="PRPM_RM301000" ref="PRPM_RM301000UV01"></artref>) R-MIM walkthrough.</p><p>Differences from Add Provider R-MIM:

support messaging necessary to report that a new record was added, or should be added, to an Organization registry system.</p><p>The <emph role="strong">Add Organization R-MIM</emph> is derived from the <emph role="strong">Personnel Management D-MIM </emph>
		(<artref ref="PRPM_DM000000" alt="PRPM_DM000000"></artref>); please refer to the documentation of the D-MIM for a detailed walkthrough of the diagram.   Following are highlights of the R-MIM and notes of changes or constraints that have been placed on the D-MIM model for this R-MIM.</p><p>The entry point to this RMIM is to the RoleChoice box with an additional constraint that messages must start with the AssignedEntity Role.  </p><p>From the RIM definition, an assigned role is an agent role in which the agent is an Entity acting in the employ of an organization. The focus of this RMIM is on the functional role performed by the organization on behalf of an organization, unlike the Employee role where the focus is on the 'Human Resources' relationship between the employee and the organization. For more information on the Human Resources model please refer to the Human Resource Topic Area within the Personnel Management domain.</p><p>The following specific notes apply to the classes in the R-MIM:</p><list role="unordered"><item>PrinicipalOrganization (entity): Identification of playing entity is optional (0..1) to support the case in which information directly related to the playing party is not needed.  </item><item>AssignedEntity (role): The role class, assigned organization, captures the critical information of the organization playing the role of interest. This includes an identifier for the role, mailing address, phone number, and the time within which the role is played (may be open ended). The scooping organization, which may be omitted if not needed, provides the organizational context for the entity that actually plays the role. For example, the role scoper will normally be the party that assigns the identifier for the role.  
	</item><item>LicensedEntity (role): The subject organization may have zero to many Licensed Entity roles. These roles capture information regarding licenses that may be relevant, and that have been issued to the organization. It is also possible to identify the organization that issued the license, i.e., the scoping organization.   
	</item><item>Member (role): The subject organization may have zero to many membership roles. Membership captures information regarding the organization's membership in Resource Groups. The vocabulary for the Membership.Code, "MemberRoleType" has been submitted for harmonization but is not currently defined as an HL7 vocabulary domain. The Member role is scoped by a single Resource Group Entity. This entity represents the Membership organization.    
	</item><item>OtherRole (role): The subject organization may be known by a variety of identifies from analogous or related roles. The OtherRole class allows these identifiers to be listed as simple references.      
	</item><item>QualifiedEntity (role): This role describes specific qualifications that may be held by an Entity (Person, Animal or Device) as a result of training or experience, but having no legal force. Example: a medical degree or diploma.     The current model does not include role attributes such as name, addr and telecom because there are no known use cases in this domain where this role is 'contactable'.
	</item><item>LanguageCommunication: This class models the language information for the subject organization. LanguageCode has been made mandatory in this model.
