Analysis is underway using an HL7 DAM (Domain Analysis Model) to determine whether a common Domain Information Model can support this variety of focus, or whether additional domain models (and thus additional domains) are needed.  If new domains are established, the specifications in the present Public Health Reporting domain are likely to be distributed among those new domains.</p></div1><div1 id="navigate-divs"><head>Message

The model initially focused on the needs of the US Federal Government for HL7 messaging in the areas of disease surveillance and the reporting of adverse events, reactions or problems related to regulated products, as well as reporting by parties investigating incidents of public concern.  However, the model is not limited to US based reporting, or to regulatory application - but has been generalized to be applicable across the HL7 community.</p><p>The conditions or events that may be subject to review or investigation (i.e., the events that may trigger an investigation) are represented by the InvestigatedEventPackage class.  These events that cause the investigation can be represented at any level of granularity (individual observations, cases, incidents, outbreaks, etc.), allowing specifications to be written with specificity appropriate to the target environment.  In addition, triggering events can be disaggregated into more granular component events using the recursive component relationship.  Subjects, assessment of relatedness to known interventions, outcomes, locations, reporters and any special qualifiers can be represented for each triggering event, and for each of its components.</p><p>The Intervention section of the model captures information about any interventions (procedures or substance administrations potentially applied to the subject of a triggering event) that might be implicated as causing or affecting the triggering events.  The actual substances or devices involved in the interventions are described in the Product section of the model.  Alternatively, these products may be investigated directly, absent an intervention in a subject, and so they are associated directly with the investigation as well.  Other clinical information about the subjects of triggering events, or about individuals significantly related to these subjects, can be reported using the ClinicalStatement section of the model.  Clinical information surrounding the interventions themselves can also be represented using this section.</p><p>The investigative process is represented in the InvestigationEvent class.  Related to this class are known sources of information for the investigation, including identified reporters, related reports, and related documents (e.g. literature citations, primary source documents such as actual lab reports, discharge summaries, etc.).  Information that is developed during the Investigation process, such as the assessment of overall seriousness, is also associated directly with the investigation.  </p><p>It is important to understand that when this model is used to develop a reporting or notification specification, some particulars of such a  report, e.g., report id, date/time of transmission, party transmitting the  report, will  not be represented by any of the elements of this model.  They will, instead, be represented through the "trigger event" act contained in the "wrapper" model that preceeds the "payload" or report contents when the message is transmitted.  It is the payload only that is derived from this DMIM</p><p>The reader should note that this DMIM may be subject to major revision in order to be harmonized with the RCRIM TC DMIM. </p></descriptive><diagref ref="PORR_DM100001UV.gif"/></dmim></dmimdivn><subdivn identifier="PORR_DO000001UV-Icsr" name="ICSR Topic" familiarName="ICSR" parent="PORR_DO000001UV-ic" id="PORR_DO000001UV-Icsr-ic" role="BC" sortPrefix="20" baseClass="ICSR" ballotStatus="NormativeStandard" ballotNumber="1"><descriptive identifier="intro-PORR_DO000001UV-Icsr" name="Introduction" parent="PORR_DO000001UV-Icsr-ic" id="intro-PORR_DO000001UV-Icsr-ic" lastEdit="2005-02-27T16:58:59"><p>The Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) topic area captures the information needed to support the reporting of adverse events or product problems associated with the use of drugs, therapeutic biologics, vaccines and devices.

Dr. Greene prescribed a course of Ciprofloxacin 250mg tablets to be orally taken twice a day for 5 days. Mrs. Jones' only other regular medication is hormone replacement therapy, for which she takes Prempak C 625micrograms.  </p><p>After three days, Mrs. Jones' UTI is resolving well, but she is experiencing increasing soreness of her left ankle. She has no recollection of injuring her ankle in any way. On the fourth day, her ankle is so sore that she makes another appointment to see Dr. Greene later that day. Dr. Greene examines Mrs. Jones and observes that her left ankle is red, stiff, hot and swollen. Mindful of Mrs. Jones' comments that she has no recollection of doing anything that might have injured her ankle, Dr. Greene wonders what other causes there might be for these symptoms. Remembering that she prescribed an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection on Monday for Mrs. Jones, she checks her clinical software for Mrs. Jones' medication record and sees the prescription for Ciprofloxacin. She then checks the electronic drug formulary for information on Ciprofloxacin and Quinolone antibiotics as a family, and it reminds her that Quinolones are known to have an adverse effect of tendonitis, especially of the Achilles tendon. The formulary advises that the medicine should be stopped immediately and the affected joint rested. </p><p>Dr. Greene's clinical judgment leads her to be confident that Mrs. Jones is experiencing an adverse drug reaction to her treatment for her UTI. She explains this to Mrs. Jones, and that she must stop the Ciprofloxacin (she feels that the UTI has resolved well), and rest her ankle, and that the ankle soreness will resolve. She may take some painkiller medication (paracetamol/acetaminophen) if she would like to. However, she would like to see her again in a week just to be sure all is well. One week later, Mrs. Jones sees Dr. Greene again. Her ankle is improving nicely and she feels that in a couple of days she will be back to normal. After she has left, Dr. Greene thinks through this incident, and decides that, due to the severity of the event she should report it to a patient safety/quality improvement organization, the relevant drug manufacturer, and regulatory authority. She logs into her clinical support system to complete an electronic Individual Case Safety Report form.  The electronic form already includes many of the details of Mrs. Jones' adverse drug event. The form appears on the screen, with some of her relevant information already filled in e.g., Mrs. Jones' demographic information, relevant medical history, lab tests and results and current medications.  The form includes Dr. Greene's progress notes and other sections ready for her input. When Dr. Greene is satisfied that the form is complete, she then authorizes her clinical support system to send the electronic report to the appropriate organization(s). </p><p>Interaction: Individual Case Safety Report (<artref ref="PORR_IN040001UV01" alt="PORR_IN040001UV"></artref>)</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORR_SN040003UV01" name="ICSR02 Event Report Revise" familiarName="Follow Up (Revise) ICSR Event Report" parent="PORR_ST040001UV01-str" id="PORR_ST040001UV01-PORR_SN040003UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="20|REPORTING" baseClass="Icsr" lastEdit="2008-06-05T15:49:29" class="changed"><p> Last week, Dr. Greta Greene submitted an Individual Case Safety report that referred to Mrs. Mary Jones' adverse drug experience with Ciprofloxacin as a treatment for UTI.

However, in a fraction of cases, while the back pain had improved, patients had experienced severe headaches.  Mr. Witherspoon, and his clients, believe CureAll is responsible, and they are seeking damages.</p><p> As Mr. Witherspoon's office signs up users of CureAll as parties to this lawsuit, they also file an ICSR for each new client.

Such a report was filed when the office agreed to represent George Gould, who stated that he was a long time CureAll user and headache sufferer.</p><p> After further discussions with Mr. Gould, it emerges that had started experiencing headaches long before his use of CureAll, and may be related to trauma he experienced as a child when he was kicked by a horse.  Once it becomes clear that CureAll cannot reasonably be involved, Mr. Gould is informed that he is being dropped from the suit.  Mr. Witherspoon's office also sends an ICSR retraction to the local regulatory agency.  </p><p>Interaction: Individual Case Safety Report Withdraw (<artref ref="PORR_IN040003UV01" alt="PORR_IN040003UV"></artref>)</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORR_SN040002UV01" name="ICSR04 Product Defect Report" familiarName="ICSR Product Defect Report" parent="PORR_ST040001UV01-str" id="PORR_ST040001UV01-PORR_SN040002UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="20|REPORTING" baseClass="Icsr" lastEdit="2008-06-05T15:49:58" class="changed"><p>Pharmacist Rebecca Rogers is preparing a solution to be used in chemotherapy for patients in General Hospital's outpatient cancer clinic.

Some FDA capabilities described in this storyboard are not currently available.</p><p><emph role="strong">The Event</emph></p><p>On December 12, 2005 Eve Everywoman, a 54 year old female was admitted to the Outpatient Surgery Center for the placement of a Portman Medical Corporation, Model LS 4700, implantable pain pump.  In surgery, the pain pump was implanted without difficulty and was determined to be functional.  After the procedure the patient was referred to the recovery area for stabilization.  In the recovery room, the anesthesiologist Dr. Sally Sleeper initiated the programming of Ms. Everywoman's implanted pump.  During this set-up procedure the pump stopped functioning and the pump's visual display went blank.  The anesthesiologist was unable to troubleshoot the cause of the device failure, nor restore its function.  The patient was informed of the device failure and opted to return to the O.R. the next day for the removal of the defective device and placement of a new pain pump.  The patient was scheduled to return to the O. R. for the repeated procedure.  The second Model LS 4700 implantable pain pump was implanted and completed its programming process without difficulty.</p><p><emph role="strong">Creation of Initial Report</emph></p><p>Dr. Sleeper decided to complete an electronic ICSR, Individual Case Safety Report, using the hospital's Incident Reporting System because he felt his patient had suffered a serious injury.  She logged into the incident reporting system and completed the necessary fields required to populate a device adverse event.  The form appeared on the computer screen with a great deal of Ms. Everywoman's patient demographics, medical history and many details of her surgical case already populated because the incident reporting system references data already stored in the patient's  electronic medical record.  The event information was obtained from the surgeon's and the anesthesiologist's progress notes and automatically populated into the appropriate fields in the form.  Once the report of the incident was completed, Dr. Sleeper clicked the submit key.  This sent the incident report to the risk manager, Patient Safety Committee, the device manufacturer and the regulatory authority.  Mr. Randy Riskers, the hospital risk manager,  reviewed the incident report, made some edits and gave approval that this was a reportable event that could be sent to FDA.  He clicked a 'Submit SMDA Event' button that electronically forwarded the ICSR report to the manufacturer.  Additionally, the hospital returned the pain pump to the manufacturer for evaluation three days after the event.  </p><p>Interaction: Individual Case Safety Report Create (<artref ref="PORR_IN049006UV01" alt="PORR_IN049006UV"></artref>)</p><p><emph role="strong">Manufacturer Response to Reported Event</emph></p><p>Two weeks after the implantable pain pump was returned to Portman Medical for failure analysis, the manufacturer sent an ICSR update to the hospital and to the FDA.

This follow up serves to respond to CDRH's request for additional information about the software issue described in a report involving a Portman Medical Corporation, Model LS 4700 implantable pain pump implanted on December 12, 2005.  The Center requested information as to the software issue described as part of the root cause analysis of the implanted pain pump's failure.  The responses to the issues posed are as follows:  The software issue described in this report was a result of an event that would take place only in the rare instances of high resistance of the motor, causing an excessive back EMF (Electromotive Force).  This would ultimately lead to an inadvertent timeout of the internal watchdog times of the microprocessor, causing the pump to turn off prematurely.  A revision to the software of the Model LS 4700 implantable pain pump has completed Portman's Engineering Design Change Process.  Additionally, testing has been conducted on the software revision and no further instances of this failure have been detected.  It is felt no further risk can be associated with this release of the software.  Once approved, new pumps being built will contain the new software revision.  FDA stores all of the information related to this event and completes appropriate review of the event.</p><p>Interaction: Individual Case Safety Report Revision (<artref ref="PORR_IN049007UV01" alt="PORR_IN049007UV"></artref>)</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORR_SN040009UV01" name="Safetyreport Dietary Supplement Icsr" familiarName="Dietary Supplement" parent="PORR_ST040001UV01-str" id="PORR_ST040001UV01-PORR_SN040009UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="20|REPORTING" baseClass="Icsr" lastEdit="2008-06-05T15:48:37" class="inserted"><p><emph role="strong">Dietary Supplement Adverse Event Storyboard</emph></p><p>Mrs. Nuclear, an 86 year old female consumed 400 IU of vitamin D made by Supplement Company IOP.

the information needed to support the reporting of individual case safety events and product problems to public health, patient safety/quality improvement organizations or regulatory agencies.  Initially, it is intended that the message support reporting of this type from healthcare providers; however the content of the message is designed to support a broader spectrum of reporters such as hospitals, contract research organizations, or clinicians.  The ICSR is also compatible with the ICH E2B M2 ICSR message transmission specification.  The initial development of this HL7 specification has been most particularly oriented towards reporting of reactions to regulated drugs.  At the same time, this model is designed to support therapeutic biologics, vaccines, and related reporting for medical devices if a device failed.  It is also intended that the messaging support the reporting of possible product problems - whether these be drug or device related.   Over time, the scope of the messaging may be expanded to include possible vaccine related incidents and problem reports as well as supporting other types of reporting needs for food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, or veterinary products and services. </p><p>The RMIM is oriented around the following concepts:  </p><p>a) Adverse events/experiences:  Any adverse event associated with the use of a product in humans, whether or not considered product related, including the following:  An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a product in professional practice, an adverse event occurring from over dose of the product whether accidental or intentional, an adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product, and any failure of expected pharmacological action.  Note that these events result in unintended harm to the patient by an act of commission or omission rather than by the underlying disease or condition of the patient.</p><p>b) Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction:  A noxious and unintended response to any dose of a drug product for which there is a reasonable possibility that the product caused the response.  In this definition, the phrase "a reasonable possibility means that the relationship cannot be ruled out.</p><p>c) Suspected medical product problems or defects: A problem that is detected before a substance is given to a patient, or a device is used for treatement.</p><p>d)  An affected person, e.g., patient.</p><p>e) Substance administrations: drugs, therapeutic biologics, vaccines.</p><p>f) Medical devices or procedures related to devices.</p><p>g) Supporting clinical information: The notion of supporting clinical information includes additional detail such as relevant observations, procedures, substance adminstrations and encounters.  These are included if the reporting party thinks them relevent, whether referring to the same point in time as the suspect event or as part of the patient history. </p><p>The model walk through below provides more information on  the way these topics are represented within the ICSR.</p><p>This RMIM is designed to support two kinds of messages.  The first type of message consists of a report on the investigation into the adverse event(s) or reaction(s) suffered by an affected person who has experienced an intervention or interventions in a therapeutic context.  The suspect event may or may not have a causal relationship with the administration of one or more pharmaceutical products, or it could be associated with a device.  The second type of message consists of a report on the investigation into a reported problem associated with a drug, biologic, vaccine or a device.</p><p>It is important to note that an actual message also includes a Control Act structure.  That area of the message includes information about the actual report transmission.  (The reader should refer to the Infrastructure Management Domain for more details.)</p><p><emph role="strong"> InvestigationEvent</emph></p><p>The InvestigationEvent serves as the entry point for the messaging model (as noted above, this entry point links back to the control act).  The investigation class captures information directly related to the investigation, and pulls together the rest of the relevant information.  Depending on the situation, the investigation will be associated either with information possibly related to a device or drug related reaction suffered by a subject, or with information related to a product (drug or device) problem.</p><p>Note; the attributes associated with an investigation are captured within the InvestigationEvent class in the RMIM.  In particular, activityTime is used to record the time that the report is completed, while availabilityTime is used to record the time on which the most recent information included within the investigation report was received.  For the sake of completeness, it is worth mentioning that the date on which the report is transmitted is captured within the Control Act structure.</p><p><emph role="strong">InvestigationEvent Associations</emph></p><p>The following associations - act relationships and participations - are defined for the investigation event itself.  Each association captures the relationship between the investigation and an entity or another type of act that plays a significant part in the investigation. (Note, the discussion of the associations has been ordered by "walking" around the central class in a clockwise direction, and that the association role text is recorded for each.  Also, as in the ultimate XML schema, the association  text is used as the tag for referring to the individual asociation.).</p><list role="unordered"><item><p><emph>document</emph>: This act relationship provides a way of capturing primary source documents and literature references that the report sender feels are relevant to the investigation, and considered part of the report.</p></item><item><p><emph>caseSeriousness</emph>: The act relationship provides a way to capture information regarding the seriousness of the suspected reaction - that is to say the extent to which the patient was injured.</p></item><item><p><emph>product</emph>: The participation captures information related to a drug or device that is the subject of a product report. (Note, this association will not exist in an event related individual case safety report.) The detailed product report is captured in the R_Drug and R_Device message element types that are defined within the PORR domain. </p></item><item><p><emph>intervention</emph>: The act relationship provides information for those interventions that are most significantly related to the suspected reaction(s) covered by the report.  This includes suspect and comcommitant interventions, as well as those performed to mitigate the effect of a suspected reaction.  This assoication also makes it possible to record the priority of each intervention for those reports in which multiple interventions are included within a single report.  This includes mitigating interventions as well as suspect ones.</p></item><item><p><emph>reaction</emph>: This act relationship relates the investigation to the reaction or reactions that are the subject of  an individual case safety report.  (Note, this act relationship will not exist in a product report.)  See below for a more detailed discussion of reactions and the items of information related to a reaction.</p></item><item><p><emph>secondaryCaseNotification</emph>: A secondary case notification is a report created by another party - such as another regulatory agency or a manufacturer - that conveys information about the event, suspected event, or possible product problem that is the subject of this report.  The report is labeled a "secondary" report to distinguish it from the initial report of the event or problem.</p></item><item><p><emph>investigation Event</emph>: The act relationship records information, most notably the assigned identifier, for individual case safety investigations that are related to this one.</p></item><item><p><emph>assignedEntity</emph>: As is usual within HL7 messaging, there may be information that captures the author and/or performers of an act.  In this case, the participation is linked to the Assigned Role.  The author or performer (whichever is being specified) is captured as the player of this role.  Information about the controlling jurisdiction, is captured as the scoper of the role</p></item></list><p><emph role="strong">Reaction</emph></p><p>A reaction is the consequence, perhaps strongly indicated, perhaps only possibly related, of the substance administration or device procedure.  It constitutes the core of the individual case safety report since, without a reaction or event, there would be no perception of an adverse reaction, and no report at all.</p><p><emph role="strong">Reaction associations</emph></p><p>The following associations - act relationships and participations - are defined for the reaction.  Each association captures the relationship between the reaction and an entity or another type of act that plays a significant part in the individual case safety report. (Note, the discussion of the associations has been ordered by "walking" around the central case in a clockwise direction.)</p><list role="unordered"><item><p><emph>interventionStub</emph>: The act relationship makes it possible to record the time interval between an intervention (adverse drug or device event) and the reaction.  It can also be used to identify the list of different interventions that are associated with the individual reaction.  The intervention stub choice box includes stub classes - containing just an id - that allow linkage to substance administration(s) or procedure(s) that have already been referenced.  Note, identifiers should be assigned which are only relevant within the context of a single ICSR in order to support cases in which patient confidentiality must be maintained.</p></item><item><p><emph>reactionRelatedness</emph>: The act relationship captures the assessment or assessments of the relatedness between an intervention and the reaction.  That is to say, it records judgments - made by the party indicated by the author or performer participation - about the extent to which the intervention caused a particular reaction.</p></item><item><p><emph>reactionEmphasis</emph>: The act relationship records the emphasis, e.g., Highlighed, that the reporter placed on the reaction.  The possible values for reaction emphasis are drawn from the ICH E2B M2 transmission message specification. </p></item><item><p><emph>outcome</emph>: The act relationship records the outcome of the reaction.  The possible values for outcome are drawn from the ICH E2B M2 transmission message specification. </p></item><item><p><emph>concurrentObservation</emph>: The act relationship captures clinical observations about the patient suffering the reaction that are directly tied to the reaction itself.  For example, age at the time of exposure.</p></item><item><p><emph>serviceDeliveryLocation</emph>: The participation captures the location at which the patient received care related to the reaction.</p></item><item><p><emph> investigativeSubject </emph>: The participation captures information about the person who, by virture of the suspected reaction, is the subject of the report.  This is person  plays the role of investigated subject.  All of the clinicial statements related to an investigation are associated with the investigation subject, or with a person - typically mother or sibling associated with the investigated subject.  The identifier in the investigated subject role is intended for disambiguating the subject of clinical statements, and for keeping track of the clinical statements linked to a particular investigation.  It should not be used to carry information that could identify the subject in any context external to the investigation.</p></item><item><p><emph>primarySourceReport</emph>: The primary source report captures information about the original report of the reaction.  This report could be from a health care provide, the patient or relative of the patient, or from another party such as a lawyer.  You should note that the primary source report could also be associated to the secondary case notifications.</p></item></list><p><emph role="strong">Affected Person</emph></p><p>This is the person directly affected by the event(s) or reaction(s).  Other parties who are directly related to the substance administration or device procedure may also be included. In the case of safety reports that involve drug administrations, it is possible for the patient to be a nursing infant or a fetus who is harmed by drugs administered to the patient's mother.  Similarly, information may be captured for siblings (this is done in the case of vaccine reactions) or other persons related to the affected person.</p><p><emph role="strong">Affected Person Roles</emph></p><p>The following associations are defined for the person or persons affected by the possible adverse event.  (Note, the discussion of the roles has been ordered by "walking" around the central affected person class in a clockwise direction. </p><list role="unordered"><item><p><emph>asResearchSubject</emph>: This association is relevant when the person suffering the reaction is also part of a clinical trial.  In that case, the cluster of classes related to ResearchSubject and Clinical Trial serves to identify the clinical trial and to provide the patient's id within that trial.  The person may be the research subject of either a pre-market or post-market clinical trial.</p></item><item><p><emph>subjectAffectedPerson</emph>: This association provides the linkage - mentioned above - to the reaction suffered by the investigated person.  It is also important to note that a wide range of information may be recorded about the patient.  This information is managed through the Clinical Statement Choice data structure, which is modeled on the emerging HL7 consensus for supporting clinical statements.</p></item><item><p><emph>relationshipHolder</emph>: In those cases in which information is collected about persons other than the person suffering the reaction, that person plays the role of the associated person scoped by the patient.  Today, these cases include mothers who ingested drugs that affected a fetus or nursing child, and siblings of persons suffering vaccine reactions.  The relationship between the associated person and the patient is indicated by AssociatedPerson.code. </p></item><item><p><emph>associatedPerson</emph>: In the situation discussed above, the patient, scopes the role of AssociatedPerson.</p></item><item><p><emph>asIdentifiedEntity</emph>: This association makes it possible to record identifiers the patient or associated person is known by.  The party issuing the identifier is indicated as the scoping entity for the IdentifiedEntity role.</p></item><item><p><emph>asPersonalRelationship</emph>: This associatiion makes it possible to record the relationship between the investigative subject and the reporter of the reaction in cases where this is relevant.</p></item></list><p><emph role="strong">Drug/Device</emph></p><p>The interventions that led to (perhaps) patient reactions or adverse events currently fall into two categories: substance administrations (drugs, biologics or vaccines), and the use of devices or device procedures.  The specific information for each suspect intervention is captured in the A_DrugIntervention and A_DeviceIntervention message element types that are associated with the <emph>InvestigationEvent </emph>through the intervention association.  These message element types are defined elsewhere within the PORR domain.  Note, interventions deemed concomitant or historical are captured directly within the ICSR RMIM as supporting clinical information, as discussed below.</p><p><emph role="strong">Supporting Clinical Information</emph></p><p>The ClinicalStatementChoice structure and all its associations captures a range of relevant clinical or contextual facts that are captured for the report.  Among other items, this includes observations from the patient's medical history, and other observations that are entered in order to provide context to the suspect event.  The attribute, ActCode, plays a key role for the obesrvations and other acts recorded within this structure.  It identifies the type of act that is being recorded or requested.  (Note, LOINC will be used for coding observations wherever possible).  As with interventions, the subject of the observation may not be the patient, but could be a person related to the patient.  Supporting clinical information could include substance administrations, procedures, encounters and supply acts as well as observations.  Within this structure is is worth noting that observations can be supported by reference ranges - as indicated by the related Observation Criterion act, that the consumable substance for a substance administration is captured as a Medication entity playing the role of administered drug, and that the product distributed in a supply act is captured in a similar fashion.  Also, the <emph>sourceOf</emph> act relationship can be used to link multiple instances of any of the acts within the choice structure.</p><p>The reader should note that the committee intends the use of supporting clinical information within the ICSR (as shown by the ClinicalStatementChoice structure) to follow the pattern supported by the general HL7 consensus for modeling clinical statements.  If that consensus is manifested in the creation of a CMET, the CMET will be used if possible.  However, the requirements of ICSR reporting have led the committee to make additions to the current clinical statement draft model.  These additions are represented by two sets of acts related to the clinical statement choice:</p><list role="unordered"><item><emph>interventionCharacterization</emph>: This act makes it possible to for a reporter to indicate the role that the primary reporter felt that the suspect intervention - either a substance administration or a device related procedure - played in the incident being reported</item><item><emph>indication</emph>: This act allows the reporter to identify the indication - the reason - for an act that was performed on the subject of the act.</item></list><p><emph role="strong">Relationship to the ICH E2BM</emph></p><p>Another perspective on this HL7 Refined Message Information Model is to compare it with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2B M2 ICSR transmission message standard.

between different jurisdictional levels within the public health system.  This specification includes, most particularly, reporting of cases subject to mandatory reporting by statute.  That is to say, it supports reporting of notifiable diseases or conditions.  It also supports related reporting such as the messages that would be sent by a field investigation team back to its supporting health department.</p><p>It is important to note that an actual message also includes a Control Act structure.  That area of the message includes information about the actual report transmission.  (The reader should refer to the Infrastructure Management Domain for more details.)</p><p><emph role="strong">Case Investigation</emph></p><p>The Case Investigation serves as the entry point for messaging.  For case reporting, a case is typically an incident of disease, whether infectious or not.  It could also reflect an incident of another type, such as an automobile or a violent crime that is being tracked for public health purposes. </p><p>In the United States, identifying data for affected purposes is commonly removed when cases are reported from a State Health Department to the Federal government (.e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).  There are other circumstances, for example, reporting from a local authority or provider to a State Health Department, or reporting between states in which identifying information is included. </p><p><emph role="strong">Participations</emph></p><p>The following participations are defined for a case.  Each participation captures the relationship between the case and an entity or another type of act that plays a significant part in the case. (Note, the participations have been ordered by "walking" around the central case in a clockwise direction.) </p><list role="unordered"><item><emph>authorOrPerformer</emph>: As is usual within HL7 messaging, there may be information that captures the author and/or performers of an act.  The particular information captured for this party is defined within the R_AssignedEntity Common Message Element Type (CMET). </item><item><emph>responsibleParty</emph>: The participation records the controlling jurisdiction, typically a national entity, for the investigation.  The particular information captured for this party is defined within the R_AssignedEntity CMET. </item><item><emph>component(Component Act)</emph>: The central content of the case report consists of a collection of significant acts related to the case.  These acts could be observations, substance administrations, or procedures. 
<list role="unordered"><item><emph>Observation</emph>: The observations include the relevant clinical or contextual facts that are captured for the case.  The attribute, ActCode, plays a key role for these.  It identifies the type of act that is being recorded or requested</item><item><emph>Substance Administration</emph>: It is often relevant to capture substance administrations related to a public health case.  A common example is the record of vaccinations that have been received by a patient.  In some cases, this could include orders for vaccinations to be administered to the patient.</item><item><emph>Procedure</emph>: It is often relevant to capture procedures related to a public health case.</item></list>


There are a number of associations that are relevant for component acts. These are discussed below.  The reader will note that some of these are only relevant for particular types of component act. 
<list role="unordered"><item><emph>authorOrPerformer</emph>: This is the party who is responsible for the information recorded for the act.  The particular information captured for this party is defined within the R_AssignedEntity CMET. </item><item><emph>location</emph>: This is the location where the act was performed. The particular information captured for this party is defined within the R_LocationServiceDelivery CMET. </item><item><emph>subject(Specimen)</emph>: Some observations are generated through direct examination of a specimen, and, when this happens, it is often relevant to collect specimen information.  The reader should note that specimen information is captured within the context of the specimen CMET.  The features of this CMET also support information about the specimen source and the act of specimen collection.</item><item><emph>consumable</emph>: A substance administration typically includes a consumable participation that makes it possible to capture information about the product administered during the substance administration.</item><item><emph>recordTarget(CaseSubject)</emph>: Component acts are most usually associated with the case subject - be it person, non person living thing or place- and in this situation the participation is inherited as part of the investigation context.  However the component act may also be related to a contact that has been associated with the case subject.  When this happens, the act subject is identified using this participation. </item><item><emph>sourceOf</emph>: This allows the creation of relationships between component acts.  For example, Component Observations can have additional observations linked to them.  This makes it possible to capture clusters or related observations which, as a whole, are related to the case.  It is also possible, and sometimes relevant, to capture participating entities, and the relevant location for an observation.  It is possible for component substance administrations or component procedures to have observations linked to them.</item></list></item><item><emph>trigger(NotifiableCondition)</emph>: The cause of an investigation is the notifiable condition that triggered the investigation of that condition.  This, most typically, is a case of infectious disease; however the list of conditions that require notification is determined by the regulations of the controlling jurisdiction. 
<p>An incident of human disease or other person related incident is the predominant trigger for case reporting, and information about the person who has come down with the disease is captured within the subject participation for the notifiable condition.  Information for patient encounters related to the notifiable condition may also be captured.  The reader should note that many of the component acts associated with the case investigation may have originally been linked with the notifiable condition.  However, in the message all the acts are related to the case investigation for the sake of simplicity. </p><p>In particular, the notifiable condition is linked to the case subject.  This normally is a person who has become ill.  However, in some situations, the subject of investigation will be an animal (non-person living subject) or a location.</p></item><item><emph>pertinentInformation(SecondaryCaseNotification)</emph>: This act provides a way of capturing information for related notifiable condition reports that the report sender feels are relevant to the investigation, and to consideration of this report  These reports are listed as secondary notifications, because they are based on the primary case notification - that is on the original report of a case from a health care provider, or other party such as a family member or member of the public.</item><item><emph>subject(PrimaryContact)</emph>:  It is often the case that the underlying justification for public health's interest in a disease or condition is related to the disease's potential to be communicated to others.  (This interest is what lies behind the designation of something as a case.) Such communicability is clearly relevant for infectious diseases; it is also relevant for toxins such as anthrax which can be dispersed from a place to persons, and passed from person to person through casual contact.  This participation captures information about persons who play the role of contact with respect to the person, place, or non-person living thing that is the subject of the case (the scoper of the contact role).  It is also possible to identify persons - secondary contacts - who come in contact with primary contacts or other secondary contacts.</item></list></descriptive><rmimref role="parent"

generalised, high level, yet encompassing report for the capture of information, in particular the circumstances surrounding an unplanned event or potential event that constitutes a Patient Safety Incident.  These incidents can be reported by individuals involved in the process of care.  The main purpose of using the GIN message is to gather snapshot information of the profile of a Patient Safety Incident (what, when, where, who) for the purpose of aggregation, analysis and learning, not specifically for the follow-up of individual reports.</p><p>A patient safety incident is defined as <emph>any unintended, expected or unexpected incident(s) that could have or did lead to harm for one or more patients receiving health care services</emph>.  [Note: staff incidents are currently not reportable via this model.]  Reports can cover actual patient safety incidents, including those caused by acts of omission, and prevented patient safety incidents (near misses).  The reported data is then aggregated and analysed by health care agencies to identify areas of concern that warrant further investigation.  The Generic Incident Notification not intended to support a detailed investigation of an incident (this will be covered by a future R-MIM - Patient Safety: Root causes and Underlying factors) nor necessarily to comply with regulatory reporting requirements.</p><p>Examples of incidents that would be reportable via the Patient Safety Generic Incident Notification are delays in access to care, medication errors, device failures, slip/trip/fall, patient misidentification, verbal/racial/sexual abuse directed towards a patient.</p><p>The Generic Incident Notification message model is described in the RMIM Walkthrough below; it is based around the concept of the report itself (the Incident Investigation), the Incident as a whole, and the Incident as it affects individual patient(s), and the Clinical Act(s) that were involved in the incident.  All key acts apart from the Clinical Act(s) are in the mood of event, because they are describing a report or an incident that has occurred.</p><p>The "reporting" nature of this messaging is such that the dynamic model for this topic is simple.  There is a sending system which informs and a receiving system that tracks that information.   Trigger events are user-based, being activated when the user takes the decisison that a report, or a revised report, is complete; and the only state used is that of "complete". The main message interaction  is therefore used to send an initial Patient Safety Generic Incident Notification, and a supplmentary message interaction is available to describe a revision of previously sent information which may be implemented if and when local business rules allow revision/update.  Apart from system level acknowledgement, no other information flows occur.</p><p><emph role="strong">Differentiation from other Incident and  Public Health Messaging Topics</emph></p><p>The Generic Incident Notification is distinct from the Individual Case Safety Report as it captures high-level information on a wide variety of patient focused incidents, which can include incidents affecting a group of patients.   In contrast, the Individual Case Safety Report is designed to support regulatory reporting of adverse incidents associated with product safety. These products relate primarily to blood, medicines, including vaccines and devices.</p><p>The Generic Incident Notification also differs from Case or Outbreak Management.  Case or Outbreak Management topics are intended to cover public health cases of reportable conditions e.g. infectious diseases.</p><p>Please note:   The documentation for this topic has been written in UK English.</p></descriptive><storydivn identifier="sbs-PORR_DO000001UV-GenericIncidentNotification" name="Storyboards" parent="PORR_DO000001UV-GenericIncidentNotification-ic" id="sbs-PORR_DO000001UV-GenericIncidentNotification-ic"><descriptive identifier="sstop-PORR_DO000001UV-GenericIncidentNotification" name="Reference" parent="PORR_DO000001UV-GenericIncidentNotification-ic" id="sstop-PORR_DO000001UV-GenericIncidentNotification-ic"><p>For details on the interpretation of this section, see <xspecref spec="v3guide.htm" ref="v3gstory" alt="the storyboard discussion"/> in the Version 3 Guide.</p></descriptive><story identifier="PORR_ST150001UV01" name="Generic Incident Notification Completion" familiarName="Generic Incident Notification Event Completion" parent="PORR_DO000001UV-GenericIncidentNotification-ic" id="PORR_ST150001UV01-str" sortPrefix="40|COMPLETION" baseClass="GenericIncidentNotification" ballotStatus="DSTU" ballotNumber="1" lastEdit="2006-10-29T12:52:25" class="changed"><descriptive identifier="purp-PORR_ST150001UV01" name="Purpose" parent="PORR_ST150001UV01-str" id="purp-PORR_ST150001UV01-str" role="purpose" lastEdit="2006-10-29T12:52:25"><p>The purpose of this storyboard is to illustrate the completion of a Patient Safety Generic Incident Notification report</p></descriptive><descriptive identifier="PORR_SN150001UV01" name="Generic Incident Notification Gin Gin Create" familiarName="Patient Monitoring Failure" parent="PORR_ST150001UV01-str" id="PORR_ST150001UV01-PORR_SN150001UV01-stex" role="storyExample" sortPrefix="40|COMPLETION" baseClass="GenericIncidentNotification" lastEdit="2007-03-02T08:46:10" class="changed"><p>Baby Ben Blue was born prematurely in Good Health Hospital at a gestation of 28 weeks; he is now four weeks old, is in the Special Care Baby Unit and is doing well, but still requires ventilation due to poorly developed lungs.</p><p>On this particular day, Ben required a chest x-ray; this involved moving him to position the x-ray plate underneath him.  To prevent the cardiac monitor and ventilator from alarming all the time while he is being re-positioned, the nurse "silenced" the alarms.</p><p>Once the x-ray was completed, the nurse and radiographer left the nursery to attend to another baby, but Baby Ben's cardiac monitor and ventilator alarms were not be re-set to sound.</p><p>During Baby Ben's repositioning at the end of the x-ray, a piece of the ventilator tubing had become disconnected; this resulted in Benbeing deprived of ventilatory support.</p><p>On returning to Baby Ben's room, the nurse noted that the cardiac monitor showed a heart rate of 40 and that Ben was cyanosed.

As well as the reporting of incidents which affect an individual and cause harm, this definition includes:</p><p> 1.  Incidents that affect several patients</p><p> 2.  Incidents that have the potential to cause harm, but which do not adversely affect a patient</p><p> 3.  Incidents that are the result of "acts of omission"</p><p>As the GIN is a high-level notification message, only information that is readily accessible soon after an incident is captured in it.  The information model assumes that there will be an electronic health record or similar to populate information about a patient's clinical condition using the clinical statement structure (A_CareStatementUniversal CMET).  The model also assumes that message implementers would want to have a choice as to the level of identifiable information they wish to capture.</p><p><emph role="strong">RMIM Walkthrough</emph></p><p>The GIN RMIM has four acts that form its main structural elements; these are the Investigation Event, the Incident Event, the Individual Patient Incident and the Supporting Clinical Statement that is a component of the Incident Event.</p><p>The <emph role="strong">Investigation Event</emph> is the entry class for the message, and describes that this is a report of a Patient Safety Incident, and it is from this class that the information about the Author of the report (and indeed the performer of any investigation that results in the report) is described.  The Investigation Event links to the Incident Event class by means of a "Reason" relationship; without the Patient Safety Incident having occurred (or being a "near miss"), there would be no reason to have a report to notify an agency about it.</p><p>The <emph role="strong">Incident Event</emph> class describes some core information about the Patient Safety incident <emph>as a whole</emph>.  This includes its type, when it occurred and any textual description of the incident.  Associated with the Incident Event class are various classes to describe where the incident occurred, who were participants in it, and what form that participation took, how the incident was discovered, whether there were any factors that might be considered to have caused the incident (and if so, what if anything has been done to mitigate those things), any actions that were taken as a consequence of the incident as a whole, and whether the incident occurred in relation to a research study, such as a clinical trial.  The Incident Event also has an association to describe if a group of patients, who are not identified separately, were involved in a patient safety incident.</p><p>The Assigned Entity CMET is used with the Participation into the Incident Event to describe any required information about the entity (person) who has been "assigned" to participate in (be employed in) the healthcare environment in which the whole Patient Safety Incident occurred, and thus who had a participation in the Patient Safety Incident in some way (including indirectly, e.g. as a witness).  This is because the focus of the GIN is to collect information from healthcare staff about Patient Safety Incidents, so the role to be described is the staff's "assigned function" within the healthcare environment.</p><p>The Choice Box giving options about who performed the Discovery of the Patient Safety Incident is designed to capture only the type (role) of the person who made the discovery (a caregiver, a healthcare professional/member of staff, or a patient (who may be involved in the incident themselves, or an observer of it).  This structure is not designed to describe any further detail about the "discoverer" since there is (currently) no requirement for this.</p><p>The <emph role="strong">Individual Patient Incident</emph> class that is linked to the Incident Event class by a component relationship, allows description of an incident <emph>as it relates to an individual patient</emph>, who may or may not be identified.  Associated with the incident as it related to one or more individual patients, there are classes that describe more specifically who was responsible for this patient at the time of the incident, any actions that were taken to minimise the effect of the incident on this patient, any actions that were taken to help the patient recover from the incident, and to describe the effect(s) of the incident on this patient.  In addition, for a "near miss" situation, there is the facility to describe any actions that were taken to "block" the patient from suffering harm from the incident.  There are also structures to describe if the patient was the subject of a care pathway at the time of the incident, how the patient can be described in terms of particular age bandings used in safety incident analysis, and, by means of the Clinical Statement structure, to describe any relevant information about the patient's clinical condition at the time of the incident.</p><p>The fourth key structure in the GIN message is the <emph role="strong">Clinical Statement CMET</emph> that is associated with the Incident Event by means of a "component of" relationship.

The ICSR message supports reporting from a variety of reporting sources such as consumers, hospitals, contract research organizations, clinicians or pharmaceutical product and medical device manufacturers.  The HL7 ICSR Release 1 specification was most particularly oriented towards reporting of reactions to regulated drugs, therapeutic biologics, vaccines, and medical devices.  In addition to the products supported in release 1, the ICSR Release 2 supports a wider variety of products including:  a) veterinary products, b) food and food additives, c) dietary supplements and cosmetics, and d) combination products.  ICSR Release 2 provides a minimal level of backward compatibility or harmonization with ICSR Release 1, by supporting concepts and attributes introduced in the original release, including international pharmacovigilence reporting requirements described in the International Conference on Harmonisation's (ICH) E2B M2 ICSR message transmission specification. </p><p>Implementation efforts by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ICSR Release 1 to support medical device reporting revealed several limitations to the standard which required substantial changes to the ICSR Release 1 RMIMs.  Some examples of these changes include streamlining the schema to support the reporting of adverse events and product problems within a single instance of the message, and the addition of a device observation class that is used to capture results from product evaluations performed by medical device manufacturers or reprocessors.  Additionally, new requirements for other FDA regulated products required the creation of generalized product and product use models to capture concepts and attributes that can be used to support combination product reporting.  The new R_Product RMIM introduced in ICSR Release 2 is based upon the Release 1 product-specific RMIMs for drugs (R_Drug) and devices (R_Device).  These RMIMs are included in Release 2 to maintain a minimal level of backward compatibility between ICSR Release and 1 and Release 2; however, the ICSR Release 1 attributes for both drugs and devices are accommodated in the new generic R_Product RMIM.</p><p>The RMIMs are oriented around the following concepts:</p><p>a) Adverse experiences:  Any adverse event associated with the use of a product in humans or animals, whether or not considered product related, including the following:  An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from overdose of the product whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from abuse of the product; an adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product; and any failure of expected pharmacological action.  Note these events may result in unintended harm to the patient by an act of commission or omission, rather than by the underlying disease or condition of the patient.</p><p>b) Suspected adverse reaction:  A noxious and unintended response to a product for which there is a reasonable possibility that the product caused the response. In this definition, the phrase "a reasonable possibility" means that the relationship cannot be ruled out.  The range of product types for which reports may be generated is set by regulatory and/or organizational administrative practice within the jurisdiction controlling the reporting between parties.</p><p>c) Suspected product problems or defects: Any problem or defect observed or detected before a product  is used.  This includes the use of drugs, biologics or medical devices used for treatment, or other consumer products such as cosmetics or dietary supplements.  Some examples of product problems include faulty packaging or labeling, receipt of an expired therapeutic drug product, or suspected contamination based upon inappropriate or unauthorized preparations or mixtures.</p><p>d) An affected person or animal:  If applicable to the report, this includes the investigative subject (patient) that experienced an adverse event.</p><p>e) Substance administrations: Includes information about how the product was given or used, or intended to be given or used by the investigative subject.</p><p>f) Medical procedures related to devices:  Includes information about how a medical device was used or intended to be used by a patient or investigative subject.  For example, device implant or removal procedures.</p><p>g) Supporting clinical information: Includes additional clinical detail such as relevant observations, procedures, substance administrations, supply acts or patient encounters.  These observations are included if the reporter considers them relevant to the investigation, whether referring to the same point in time as the suspect event or as part of the patient's medical history. </p><p>The ICSR RMIM is designed to support within a single structure two aspects of product reporting.  These include: 1) a report about the investigation into the adverse event(s) or reaction(s) suffered by an affected person or animal that experienced an intervention or interventions in a therapeutic context.  The suspect event may or may not have a causal relationship with the administration or use of one or more products; and 2) a report about the investigation into a product problem.  Note that the key common factor is the involvement of an implicated product such as a medication, device, dietary supplement or cosmetic.</p><p>This message, as with all HL7 V3 specifications, includes a Control Act structure which contains information about the actual report transmission.
