The domain description discusses the overall scope of the domain with a few supporting domain storyboards. The detail found in the description of the domain information model emphasizes the focal class of the domain, the Care Provision Act. The remaining documentation on the other classes in the domain is found in the Care Structures Topic, where much of the detailed clinical information is represented.</p><p>Both the Care Provision Domain and the Care Structures Topic provide a good amount of theory and guidance to the detailed reader. As well there are two Reference documents <emph>Explanation and Guidance Topic</emph> and the <emph>Requirements Analysis Artifacts Topic</emph>.  The <emph>Explanation and Guidance Topic </emph>provides background to engineers writing implementation guides to ensure good clinical functionality in the document, message, and service specifications created from the models.  </p><p>The Care Provision Domain Relationships Diagram illustrates the DSTU Topics as well indicates the ongoing work occurring within Patient Care.</p><p><graphic source="T-REPC_NA000002.jpg"></graphic></p></div1><div1 id="prefAck"><head>Acknowledgements</head><p>The Patient Care technical Committee would like to recognize the contributions of the following authors / editors, developers and organizations without whom this document could not have been produced:   </p><p>Dan Russler Daniel Russler, MD, VP of Clinical Informatics, Oracle, USA who is a primary author and editor in the following DSTUs:  the Domain Model (REPC_DO000000UV), Care Record, Care Record Query, Care Transfer, and Care Structures Topics.     </p><p>Heath Frankel, BSc, Frankel Informatics, Australia who is a primary author and modeling facilitator in the following DSTUs:  the Domain Model (REPC_DO000000UV), Care Record, Care Record Query, Care Transfer, and Care Structures Topics.     </p><p>Isobel Frean RN, MSc. who provided the major contribution of storyboard content.

role="strong">Scope of Care Provision Domain: </emph>The Care Provision Domain addresses the information that is needed for the ongoing care of individuals, populations, and other targets of care. The "Act of Care Provision" is the recording of a process that defines the responsibility for supplying support to the target of care. It is a statement of SUPERVISION, MANAGEMENT, and CUSTODY.</p><p>The people or other entities associated with "Responsibility for Care," are divided into the providers and targets of care, where a patient may be considered both a provider and a target of care and where any person may carry multiple roles. The scope of the "Responsibility for Care" is defined in three "layers." (1) The Act of Care Provision represents a kind of responsibility defined by CareProvision.code, which usually represents the scope of responsibility described by a governmental license, a certification agency, or other legally recognized entity such as the patient themselves. (2) The reasons for the Care Provision further constrains the scope of responsibility to one or more "Concerns" (3) The third layer expresses the Care Plans or management plans. These plans further identify the expectations for specific actions to be performed via the component relationship. The first layer is required in a statement of responsibility; the second two layers, which constrain the first layer, are optional. </p><p>In the context of HL7, a "Concern" is worry about a state or process that has the potential to require intervention or management. A problem list is an example of a list of concerns. </p><p>For example, diabetes may be on the problem list. However, the scope of responsibility for an endocrinologist might be only the diabetes and not the other problems. Diabetes is then identified as the reason for the Care Provision. The expectation of the endocrinologist may only include recommendations for a modification to the diabetes care plan. This specific diabetes care plan modification is then a component of the Care Provision scope of responsibility.</p><p>In the same way in the public health arena, the responsibility for a population may be limited to managing an Outbreak of infectious disease. </p><p>Therefore, the essential concept in this Care Provision Domain is the recording of the responsibility for care provision. Management plans (care plans) for the subjects of concern may be included in the scope of the responsibility for care provision. </p><p>This domain also includes the transfer of responsibility for care and the updating of pertinent information about respective responsibilities between collaborating care providers, such as the communications that occur when a patient is discharged from the hospital to a home health agency. This domain recognizes the fact that care coordination often includes many types of providers that care for people, devices, facilities, and the general environment, not just clinicians delivering direct care to a patient. The pertinent information regarding care provision may include general summary information or granular primary information, but may not carry all the information known about a specific instance in the generating system. However, in general, the scope of the domain includes all the information needed for decision support by a care provider. At a minimum, the domain includes the identifiers and other data needed to query a source system for the additional information needed for care. The scope is formalized in the following scope statement.</p><p>The Care Provision Domain describes information structures and vocabulary used to communicate information pertinent to the care of living subjects, devices, geographic sites, and other physical entities by a responsible care provider. This domain supports multiple specifications appropriate to referrals and record communications supporting collaboration and the continuity of care between care providers.
	</p><p>Among other more generalized care activities that can be defined by analogy and interpretation of the scope above, the Care Provision Domain specifically supports:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Sharing of health record extracts and event summaries of the health record between collaborating providers (including the patient) in order to support the clinical decision support activities of the receiving persons or systems.</item><item>Request for the transfer of patient care responsibility of a specific type of care by a healthcare provider by a requesting healthcare provider, a responsible party, such as a care coordinator, advocate or family member or the patient themselves. </item><item>Acceptance or rejection of a request for care transfer as well as the ability to provide information about the intent to provide care to the requesting party. </item><item>Communication of a summary of relevant findings and outcomes of the care provided in response to a request for further information.</item></list><p><emph role="strong">Limits of Scope: </emph>The scope of the Care Provision Domain is also limited by its focus on Care Provision Act, "an HL7 Act that describes "the responsibility for supplying support to the target of care."</p><p>The Care Provision Domain is not intended to represent all the information communicated by systems that originate detailed pertinent information such as observation data or person registration data. The domains that support communication from these data generating systems tend to supply much more detail regarding the complex data context within which the data was generated. In that spirit, the intention of the Care Provision Domain is to communicate the instance identifiers and meta data for these granular instances of data such that the receiving system has enough information to query sending systems for more detail on specific items of pertinent information (assuming the sending systems support queries and instance identifiers).</p><p><emph role="strong">Readers: </emph>Please see the Glossary Section for terms important to the Care Provision Domain</p><p><emph role="strong">Care Provision Domain and Care Structures Topic Ballot Guidance</emph>:Except for the Care Structures Topic, all the other topics under the Care Provision Domain relate to implementation specifications.

The walk-throughs of these patterns are included in the Care Structures Topic section. These patterns are expressed in the topic section as RMIM's and HMD's.

The CMET's described in the Care Structures Topic include many structures such as: Care Statement; Condition Tracking; Worklist; Care Plan; and Guideline, among others. These CMET's are utilized in the message specification topics such as the Care Transfer and Care Record Topics in order to simplify the illustrations. </p><p>However, in this section, the focus will be on the meaning of the Care Provision Act and on the associations surrounding the Care Provision Act. </p><p><emph role="strong">1.2.2.2 Care Provision Act in Patient Care</emph></p><p>An understanding of this act is central to the concept of patient care by professionals. Normally, a patient is completely responsible for his or her own care. However, when people are ill, it is difficult for them to be completely responsible themselves. Part of the process of healthcare is that patients request that healthcare providers help them with their care. This request to help is central to the contract between patients and their healthcare providers. It is also common in healthcare for one professional to request the help of another professional in the context of this contract with the patient. This Care Provision Act represents a statement about the scope of responsibility that is shared between the patient, sometimes family members, and one or more healthcare providers. The discussion that follows is intended to further elucidate the concept of shared responsibility and extends the patient-related concepts of care to Care Provision in general.  </p><p>Care Provision Act: The meaning of the Care Provision Act begins with an examination of the meaning of "Care" and the meaning of "Provision" in the context of this domain. </p><p><emph role="strong">Stipulated Dictionary Definitions: </emph></p><emph role="strong">Care</emph> (5): CHARGE, SUPERVISION, MANAGEMENT: responsibility for or attention to safety and well-being (under a doctor's...), (the ... of all the churches) CUSTODY: temporary charge   <p><emph role="strong">Provision </emph>(2a): the act or process of providing (the ... of a play area for the children)  </p><p><emph role="strong">Provide </emph>(3): to supply what is needed for sustenance or support (the Lord will...), (we'll have to ... for him)  Merriam- Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged, copyright 1961-2002.   </p><emph role="strong">Guidance</emph>: In the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM), the term "Act" always represents the record of the "process of doing." "Care Provision" represents a constraint on the definition of "Act" that takes the form, "The Act of Care Provision" where "Care Provision" is the noun form of the infinitive "to provide care." Therefore, the "Act of Care Provision" is the recording of a process that defines the responsibility for supplying support. It is a statement of SUPERVISION, MANAGEMENT, and CUSTODY.   <p>In healthcare, many workers are assigned to the care of facilities and devices as well as living subjects. This Act of Care Provision is to be used when the explicit accountability for the care of a living or non-living subject is a component of the intended semantic. In other words the subject of care is defined in the subject participation, which constrains the semantic of care provision, e.g. subject is in a patient role; subject is in the role of a manufactured device.</p><p>In healthcare, the condition of the medical device, home of the patient, or other non-living subjects may need to be managed as well as the conditions of the patients' bodies themselves. Accordingly, "Care Provision" is often combined with the HL7 concepts of "Condition Tracking" and "Care Plan," structures that are found in the Care Structures Topic.</p><p>Examples: equipment care, patient care, facility care, responsibility for population monitoring, responsibility for an environmental site.   </p><p>Other Examples of the Scope of Care Provision include: </p><list role="ordered"><item>preferred primary care provision: the primary care physician being the primary performer participation, author being the patient</item><item>referral from general practitioner to specialist: (a Care Provision in request mood, where the author participant is the GP, and the primary performer participation is the specialist)</item><item>case management: case manager is the performer to a patient or group of patient subject participants</item><item>coverage assignment: assigning nurses to patients each shift </item><item>environmental site care: the environmental site is the subject participant and a company is the performer participant  </item><item>population monitoring: a population is the subject participant and the government agency is the performer participant</item></list><p><emph role="strong">1.2.2.3 Care Provision DMIM Walk-through</emph></p><p><emph role="strong">CareProvision Focal Class</emph></p><p>The Care Provision act is used to describe all aspects of care provision like the name of care professionals and the patient details.  This central act has relationships to itself and several other acts. Most of these relationships connect directly to acts of the Care Statement eg (observation, activities, encounters). It also has Participations which define roles of entities, e.g. the role of patient or provider of care. The details of the Care Provision Domain are described hereafter, beginning with the attributes.</p><p><emph role="strong"><emph>CareProvision Attributes </emph></emph></p><emph role="strong">classCode:</emph> The vocabulary domain specified for Act.classCode includes PCPR (Patient Care Provision) as a specialization of the Act class.       <p><emph role="strong">moodCode: </emph>Like all Acts in the RIM, the Care Provision Act may be expressed in many moods.These moods distinguish the different aspects of the business lifecycle of a Care Provision Act. These moods, which are central concepts for the DMIM, are defined as follows:   </p><table border="1" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><emph role="strong">Code </emph></td><td><emph role="strong">Definition  </emph></td></tr><tr><td>RQO (request) </td><td>A "Care Transfer Request" is a question to another care provider regarding their ability to accept the responsibility of Care Provision for the subject. Typically the request is made by a care provider, recorded within one computer system, and then transmitted to a second system for analysis and response by the receiving care provider. However, support is also provided to allow the patient to self-refer themselves. A referring Responsible party such as a State or Court may also author a Care Transfer Request. In a Care Transfer Request, the receiving provider is listed as the performer. The scope of responsibility including CareProvision.code, reasons for care provision, and component care plans that set the specific expectations for care apply to the scope of responsibility for the receiver of the request.  </td></tr><tr><td>PRMS (promise) </td><td>A "Care Provision Promise" is the statement of commitment to accept the responsibility of Care Provision as specified in the promise. It is assumed the receipt of a request message triggers a promise across a messaging interface from the requesting party. Due to the patient safety implications of care responsibility, there is no support for the type of "Implicit Promise" found in the Lab Domain. An acceptance of responsibility must be communicated as an explicit Promise. In this case, the performer is the sender of the promise. Likewise, the scope of responsibility including CareProvision.code, reasons for care provision, and component care plans that set the specific expectations for care apply to the scope of responsibility for the sender of the promise.  </td></tr><tr><td>EVN (event) </td><td>An Event according to the RIM is a service that actually happens, may be an ongoing service or a documentation of a past service.  <p>For Care Provision, a Care Provision Event is a record, which summarizes the events that happened during care including who is responsible for the care provided. An author of the "Care Provision Event" records and summarizes the events The performer is responsible for carrying out the care events.   The author and performer can be the same person.  Care Provision Event messages may be sent during the course of care to describe the progress of care or may be sent at the termination of care to describe all the activities that occurred during the provision of care. In this case, the performer is the sending provider.</p></td></tr><tr><td>DEF (definition) </td><td>Definition mood code can be used to express a guideline or protocol.</td></tr><tr><td>INT (intent)</td><td>Intent can be used to express the intended activities in a care plan. In particular the appropriate selection of observations and activities from a guideline that are included in the care plan for one particular patient. So the intended Acts are individualized from the guideline.  </td></tr><tr><td>PRP (proposal)</td><td>Proposal is used to suggest an idea to someone else, but not with the status of a request. It is further used as placeholder for the use in Care Plan R-MIM. For instance, it can be used by a consultant to recommend a course of action.    Care Provision Acts in different moods are linked by the fact that promises are created to fulfill requests, and events are created to fulfill promises and/or requests.     </td></tr></tbody></table><p><emph role="strong">id: </emph>This attribute identifies a particular Care Provision. Identifier attributes can be used to identify an instance of a class. Sometimes more than one attribute may be needed to identify an instance of a class. The identifier attributes always have a value. The values of identifier attributes are unique among all instances of the class. Since identity is static, values of identifier attributes never change. Identifier attributes are assigned the set of instance identifier (SET&lt;II&gt;) data type and generally have the name "id" that allow for multiple identifiers to be specified.  The identifier attribute is a set of instance identifiers. This indicates that there may be multiple, unique identifiers for an Act. In the CareProvision Act, the "id" is used to give a unique id to all information that belongs together. It is used to identify the current care provision concerning a particular condition and the responsible providers. It is further used in queries and to trace back information of earlier care provisions for e.g. predecessor conditions, or related conditions and so on.     </p><emph role="strong">code: </emph>This attribute describes a kind of Care Provision Act in accordance with the definition of Act.code in the RIM. At this point in time, this attribute is CWE, and no value set is currently defined. CareProvision.code represents the kind of care provision and the person that is responsible for it. This guidance applies:   Care Provision is a statement of responsibility. The code for this statement should apply to a commonly accepted legal/regulatory/accrediting standard scope for responsibility. It is understood that these may differ by jurisdiction. In the US Realm, examples include: JCAHO; state licensing of hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies; medical and nursing specialty boards; etc. For example, a hospital discharge summary in a Wisconsin licensed hospital might use a code for "Wisconsin hospital care" or perhaps a JCAHO-certified acute care designation. This code is not to be interpreted as a setting code or an encounter code, but must be consistent with other related concepts, i.e. document type, encounter type, and scoping organizations for licensure or accreditation of participating providers. Local needs may require extensions of any given value set depending on local regulations and accreditations. A general value set for these concepts (that is expected to be extended by local agreement) will be defined by HL7, since external vocabularies do not at this time support this concept.   <p>The intention for the use of CareProvision.code is to define a traditional scope of domain expertise, e.g. Orthopedic Care; Oncology Care; Acute Care; Long-term Care, etc. This scope described by this general domain of expertise would then be further constrained by the list of Conditions listed as Reasons for Care and the Care Plans identified as components of the Care Provision Act. This entire scope of care is then included in the particular request, promise, or delivery of care represented by the mood codes used in the Care Provision Act.</p><p>For the time being, any act.code from any code system can be included here. For example codes from SNOMED CT:  </p><list role="unordered"><item>Preventive care:169443000: preventive procedure</item><item>Surgery: 257556004: surgery</item><item>Delivery: 386216000: human parturition, function</item></list><p>Each coding system is identified by the Object Identifier (OID), e.g. for SNOMED CT this would be: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.5      </p><p><emph role="strong">derivationExpr: </emph>The derivation expression attribute allows a string expression on derivation and is supported in an observation instance.

The party who is intended to receive the care transfer request or confirmation, or the record of care provision.  In the case of a care transfer request, the recipient is not the requested performer of the care provision but is receiving the request for the recipient's information and they do not need to act on the request.  Alternatively, the intended recipient of a care transfer confirmation (promise) is usually the author of the corresponding request but may also be a "copy to" recipient.

The component3 relationship has a source of CareProvision and a target that is another Care Provision, and is used to create groupings of CareProvisions in a more or less hierarchical order. E.g. for Care Provision that is given to a patient to treat a complication, like treatment for an allergy for antibiotics, part of an overall care provision for an infection.  <p> Categories of information may not only be considered "pertinent to the care," but also identified as part of the scope of responsibility for care defined by the Care Provision Act. In this case, the "Component" relationship is used instead of the "Pertinent Information" relationship.

These are described as local CMET's which are local to the Care Provision Domain. These local CMET's will be submitted to the pool of shared HL7 CMET's if these local CMET's pass ballot at the domain level. These CMET's or building blocks within the Care Provision Domain represent re-usable objects in larger model diagrams. This allows for a more efficient use of space when reviewing models on a screen.</p><p>In many cases, these structures extend the basic assertion for responsibility of care by naming both concerns and care plans as components of the scope of responsibility. Care Structures represent the variable parts of a communication regarding the responsibility for Care Provision. As described in the scope of the Care Provision Domain, this care is provided to individuals, populations, and other targets of care, and communications with this information are designed to support the collaborations between care providers. This Care Structures Topic exists under the Care Provision Domain. For a full description of the domain and a discussion of the responsibility for care, please see the Care Provision Domain Overview. </p><p>The types of information modelled in Care Structures include</p><list role="unordered"><item><p>Basic Care Statements, i.e. raw data with minimal summarization or interpretation, e.g. body weight, blood pressure, height</p></item><item><p>Summary information created in lists, e.g. medication lists, surgery lists</p></item><item><p>Judgment-related Care Statements, e.g. problem lists, allergy lists, diagnostic scales such as Depression scales, Barthel index for Activities of Daily Living or risk for patient falls</p></item><item><p>Care plans and their associated guideline definitions; what was completed and what has yet to be completed</p></item><item><p>Concern Tracker to follow a problem of a patient over time, provider and location</p></item><item><p>Statements about the situation of patient caretakers such as family members</p></item></list><p>Of course, the pertinent information included in an individual communication regarding patients is going to vary depending on the needs of the patient and the needs of the collaborating healthcare providers. The addition of Care Structures to messages at run-time allows messages to grow as needed.</p><p>This Topic references the Clinical Statement Pattern Domain (a separate ballot pool from the Care Provision Domain) and guides readers on how to ballot specific Clinical Statement issues. Only Care Provision modifications of the Clinical Statement Pattern will be balloted through the Care Structures Topic. Specific Care Structures include the Concern Tracking Structure, the Care Plans/Guidelines Structure, and Assessment structures as well as the most important care structure, the Care Provision Domain version of the Clinical Statement choice box referred to in this Topic document as the Care Statement Structure.</p><p><emph role="strong">4.0.2 Limits of Scope</emph></p><p>The Care Structures are not intended to represent all the information communicated by systems that originate detailed pertinent information such as observation data or person registration data. The domains that support communication from these data generating systems tend to supply much more detail regarding the complex data context within which the data was generated. In that spirit, the intention of the Care Structures are to communicate the instance identifiers and meta data for these granular instances of data such that the receiving system has enough information to query sending systems for more detail on specific items of pertinent information (assuming the sending systems support queries and instance identifiers). However, other implementation specifications may extend this scope on Information Content to require more detail in the original communication and depend less on query and response methodologies. 
  </p><p>These Care Structures may be further constrained for use in other Care Provision Domain topics and/or implementation guides from different committees and organizations external to HL7. It is NOT the intent that this Care Structures Topic describe all the possible constraints on these more general Care Structures.</p><p><emph role="strong">4.0.3 Placement of Care Structures within the Care Provision Domain Model: </emph></p><p>The structures to the right of the Care Provision Act are described in the following narrative:</p><p><emph role="strong">4.0.3.1  Summary of Care Structures</emph></p><p>The Care Structures topic is intended to provide a library of reusable and substitutable care structures derived from the Care Provision DMIM. Currently the topic provides only the core structures from which specific care structures such as Blood Pressure and Allergies can be derived. Some of these specific care structures are provided as informative examples:</p><p>Normative Care Structures:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Care Statement     </item><item>Composition Content     </item><item>Statement Collector     </item><item>Concern Tracking Structure    </item><item>Care Provider     </item><item>Care Target     </item><item>Involved Person   </item></list><p>Informative Care Structures:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Blood Pressure</item><item>Heart Rate</item><item>Weight</item><item>Height</item><item>Allergy</item><item>Barthel Index</item></list><p><emph role="strong">4.0.3.2 Local CMET's</emph></p><p>The Care Structures presented within this section are provided as local CMET's (local to the Care Provision Domain). A Care Structure CMET uses the Common Message Element Type approach for representing reusable structures for use within the Care Provision Domain, which is derived from its DMIM. The CMET is used to represent these complex care structures that are used in multiple RMIMs. This simplifies the RMIM dramatically allowing the focus to be on the focal class and its association while supporting the substitution of constrained CMET for a universal CMET at either message design, implementation or creation time.</p><p>The Care Plan, Involved Person, Care Provider and Care Target structures currently do not have further constrained models but have been provided as a Care structure for reuse purposes.</p><p>An important concept in this Topic is the Hierarchy of Constraints on the abstract structures in the Care Provision DMIM. The Care Statement structure has been constrained to define the Concern Tracking Structure. The Composition Content structure is also a constraint on the Care Statement. Any of these constraints can be substituted for the Care Statement which is associated with the Care Plan and Statement Collector structures, and the Care Provision Act. </p><p><emph role="strong">4.0.3.3 Clinical Statement Pattern</emph></p><p>As mentioned above, the ballot pool for this document focuses on the extensions and constraints that the Care Provision Domain has applied to the Clinical Statement Pattern. These extensions or constraints will be clearly identified in the narrative on each care structure. Ballot issues related to the Clinical Statement Pattern itself should be directed to the Clinical Statement Pattern ballot pool. For contrast, the Clinical Statement Definition is compared to the Care Statement Definition.
  </p><p><emph role="strong">Clinical Statement Definition (to be balloted in the Clinical Statement Pattern ballot pool)</emph></p><p>The formal definition of clinical statement for the care of patients is:</p><indent><p><emph>An expression of a discrete item of clinical (or clinically related) information that is recorded because of its relevance to the care of a patient."</emph></p><p>Clinical information is fractal in nature and therefore the extent and detail conveyed in a single statement may vary.</p><p>To be regarded as a clinical statement, a concept must be associated with a patient in a manner which makes clear:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Its temporal context</item><item>Its relationship to the patient</item><item>In the case of an observation: its mood and presence, absence or value</item><item>In the case of a procedure:its mood and status</item></list><p>This clarity may be achieved by:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Explicit representation; or</item><item>Implicit application of defaults ONLY where explicitly modeled rules state the appropriate default</item></list></indent><p>The Clinical Statement Pattern is a generalized HL7 abstract pattern used in multiple HL7 domain message information models that provides basic data about the target of care. This HL7 Pattern may be constrained, extended, or left unchanged by HL7 Technical Committees, which use this pattern in the definition of a domain.</p><p><emph role="strong">4.0.3.4 Care Statement Structure</emph></p><p>As you refer back to the Clinical Statement Pattern, you will see that there are no major differences between it and the Care Statement Structure seen below.</p><artref alt="REPC_RM000100" ref="REPC_RM000100"></artref><p><emph role="strong">4.0.3.4.1 Extensions on the Clinical Statement Pattern Domain</emph></p><p>The Clinical Statement Pattern is renamed the Care Statement Structure in this Care Structure Topic in order to emphasize that Care may apply to medical devices, facilities, and environmental sites as well as patients. In that sense, the vocabulary used to support Care Statements is more extensive than the vocabulary used to support simply the care of patients. These extensions will be documented by a gradual increase in the number and variety of HL7 vocabulary value sets. 
  </p><p>The intention is that a care statement instance may be added by itself to the Care Provision Act at creation of the RMIM or added at run-time execution of an application in order to support the variability of extent and detail described in the clinical statement definition above. Of course, the care statement may be added to the Care Provision Act along with adding the other structures of the Care Provision Domain as well.</p><p>The extension of clinical statement to care statement extends the definition of care statement to:</p><indent><p> An expression of a discrete item of care-related information that is recorded because of its relevance to the care of a target of care.

The reason for this important constraint is that the extensive use of ActReference and queries in the Care Provision Domain depends on the existence of instance identifiers. These instance identifiers normally have been generated by the system authoring the instance. However, many instance identifier strategies exist and the only assumption in this constraint is that an instance identifier uniquely identifies the instance in systems to be queried. Instances may be privately communicated from an originating system to a receiving system or interface engine which adds unique system identifiers and then re-sends the instances out to other systems. In this case, the original system cannot be queried. Only the systems that have generated or received unique instance identifiers can be queried. 
  </item><item>Two constraints are added to specific Care Structures classes from the Infrastructure Root Class: InfrastructureRoot.realmCode; InfrastructureRoot.templateID. These constraints are intended to be used in Care Structures in the same way they are used in CDA Release 2 documents. That is, until more specific HL7 methods are agreed upon for templates, the template ID refers to a unique specification guide within a Care Provision Topic. The realmCode is then used to further constrain a template ID, giving different realms the ability to leverage a specific template in a unique way (especially by additional constraints on vocabulary usage). All of the Classes in the Care Statement include the templateId and realmCode attributes. 
  </item><item>Care Structure Constraints: The Clinical Statement Pattern is very general and allows all clinical Statements (or in the case of this Topic, the "Care Statements) to be represented from recursions on the ClinicalStatement choice. However, in the Care Structure Topic, as a Care Structure derived from the Care Statement Pattern is unrolled and defined, the Care Statement is constrained from representing that same structure in the same RMIM. In other words, in the same RMIM, one must not represent concern events both in the Concern Tracking Structure and from Concern Acts constructed from the CareStatement. Therefore, the following Care Structures each act as a constraint on the Care Statement when the derived Care Structure and the Care Statement are used in the same RMIM. 
  </item></list><p>Over time, the Care Structures Topic will include additional Care Structures that may be used by specific realms for specific purposes with specific constraints on vocabulary through the use of the HL7 attributes, InfrastructureRoot.templateId and InfrastructureRoot.realmCode. In this way, constraints will be explicitly defined in both the unrolled portions of the structure and the remaining, constrained, Care Statement portion of the structure. Consequently, when the publication of templates is defined, many Care Structures published in this document may be re-classified and published as templates instead.</p><p>In the following section, the RMIM's for the specific Care Structures will be described. They will be described first in a "clinically relevant manner" in a general narrative. Following the general clinical narrative, there will be a formal walk-thru developed as found in a typical engineering specification. Not all of the formal walk-thru's have been completed for this ballot.</p></descriptive><rmimdivn identifier="rmims-REPC_DO000000UV-CareStructures" name="Refined Message Information Models" parent="REPC_DO000000UV-CareStructures-ic" id="rmims-REPC_DO000000UV-CareStructures-ic"><descriptive identifier="rmop-REPC_DO000000UV-CareStructures" name="Reference" parent="REPC_DO000000UV-CareStructures-ic" id="rmop-REPC_DO000000UV-CareStructures-ic"><p>For details on the interpretation of this section, see <xspecref spec="v3guide.htm" ref="v3grmim" alt="the description of RMIMs"/> in the Version 3 Guide.</p></descriptive><rmim identifier="REPC_RM000120UV01" name="Care Structures Event Assessment Scale" familiarName="A_ObservationAssessmentScale" parent="REPC_DO000000UV-CareStructures-ic" id="REPC_RM000120UV01-rmi" sortPrefix="07|20|99|ASSESSMENT SCALE" baseClass="CareStructures" ballotStatus="DSTU" ballotNumber="1" class="changed" lastEdit="2008-06-04T15:58:05"><descriptive identifier="desc-REPC_RM000120UV01" name="Description" parent="REPC_RM000120UV01-rmi" id="desc-REPC_RM000120UV01-rmi" lastEdit="2008-06-04T15:58:05"><p><emph><emph role="strong">Assessment Scales Structure Overview:</emph></emph></p><p>
  Assessment scales are becoming more and more common in healthcare. For many years, the APGAR scale has been used to evaluate a newborn immediately after birth. Another example is the Barthel index, used mostly by nursing. The aim of the Barthel Index is to be able to capture and follow the level of help required by the patient in the performance of activities of daily life. (Mahoney Barthel, 1965) 
  <sup>1</sup> 
  . The scientific validation for the Netherlands was carried out by de Haan et al (1993) 
  <sup>2</sup> 
  . It appears that the Dutch version of the scale is valid and reliable for individual use and for use in populations (epidemiological research), as a measure of outcome, for example. There are realm specific differences in the original English and the translated Dutch version of the scale, e.g. the value sets differ. The total score of the index depends on individual component scores on ten variables. 
  </p><p>The model for the Barthel Index starts with the naming on top (entry-point), with the name Barthel_Index. Beneath that is the act type Observation(OBS) with the name Barthel_Index. This is the central OBS for this model. In this act the total score of the Barthel Index is shown. The class Barthel Index has class code = OBS. Furthermore, the field for code system should be filled with the Barthel Index. In the derivation code the total score for the Barthel Index is recorded. In other words: derivation method = add all values of the separate variables. Effective time is the point in time on which the Barthel Index is scored. In the value, which was created by adding the individual variables, is filled up. This is always an INT data type because it is mandatory to score and fill up all items to get a proper sum score. That is why Mandatory (1..1). Interpretationshows how the total score should be interpreted. This is 0-9 for seriously limited, 10-19 for moderately limited and 20 for independent.</p><p>The OBS Barthel_Index contains ten variables itself, which each contain another OBS. These are bowels, bladder, grooming, toilet use, feeding, transfers, mobility, dressing, stairs and bathing respectively. For each of them the scoring options of 0 up to 3 are given in the field ObservationMethod. The result of the score comes in to the field value. For all OBS the time can be recorded in effective time. In codea unique code is given for the concerning variable. In earlier versions ICF codes were used, however, these cause too much confusion with other similar observations of the patient one wants to record.</p><p><sup>1</sup><emph>Mahoney, F.

In order to allow this within the mechanics of the HL7 v3 messaging, the Concern Act class is introduced and fully explained in this Concern Tracking Topic area of this ballot. </p><p>The Concern Tracking Structure supports the expression of concerns about situations pertaining to selected entities that are the target or subject of care. It organizes basic clinical data into a longitudinal data structure, which supports tracking and management of complex processes over time.</p><p>Definition of Concern Class as result of harmonization work:  An interest or focus of attention that tends to persist over time and has as a subject a state or process.  The subject of the interest or focus of attention has the potential to require intervention or management.  </p><p>Concern tracking is used to implement the problem-oriented medical record concept introduced by Larry Weed in the 1960's and 1970's. For engineers, the problem-oriented medical record can be considered a health care version of industrial project management processes that focus on issue resolution. The intention of this model is to support both the tracking of these concerns at the "high-level" as well as the detailed tracking of complex management processes at the "low-level." The decision on whether to track concerns at the high-level or low-level is to be an application-dependent decision. Applications may use techniques described in this section to track concerns but are not required at this level of the specification to include all the tracking information. </p><p>Examples of use for the Concern Class include but are not limited to: an observation result in form of a diagnosis e.g. a patient having cancer which gives the concern a name, a procedure such as amputation of the left leg requiring care management, a substance administration, e.g. receiving cytotoxic drugs requiring extra management, equipment repair status, device recall status, a health risk, a financial risk, public health risk, pregnancy, disease, complaint. In particular this concern class is used to group information about, or to follow up on, a specific episode of care, or a care need or patient problem, especially if more than one provider is involved in the care. </p><p>In the usual course of presentation, diagnosis, and treatment, the caretaker of a concern gains a gradually better understanding of the concern.  An example of a concern in the disease management area is the Episode of Illness.
</p><p>In a typical clinical scenario, the patient presents to the clinician with the "chief complaint." This chief complaint or chief concern is one of many symptoms that represent the patient's view of the primary problem from which the patient is suffering. Multiple questions and exams are performed on the patient, which provides a data set from which a clinician may develop a viewpoint on the concern (the abductive or "hypothesis generating" phase of the process as described by Peirce). On the basis of this initial understanding of the concern, tests are ordered and observations carried out by the clinician and time passes. Frequently, the disease evolves and demonstrates more symptoms and signs. At each point in time during multiple contacts with the patient or with patient data, the clinician has evolved a set of potential diagnoses. In addition, during each point in time, various treatments may be recommended by the clinician, citing the concern as the reason for the various treatments. </p><p>One business need filled by the Concern Tracking Structure is to support the direct care of the patient with an organized model for representing multiple contacts with the subject of care while the concern is evolving, data is being collected, and treatments are being applied. In addition, the business needs of quality improvement and cost accounting performed by data mining applications are supported by tracking the evaluation and management actions associated with the concern.</p><p>Thus the concern class can function as a grouper for all activities associated with a specific patient-related problem. The problem can, due to different observations, evolve over time and can be tracked or managed by one or more care professionals. Different professionals may have different opinions of the nature of the problem, but all their observations are grouped under the same concern.   So essentially, the concern class is used to track what affects the patient. It is independent of the assigned profession, and can have different personal diagnoses attached. It is what ties all underlying activities (Acts) together. See figure 1 for how some of these concerns can relate to each other:  </p><p>Figure 1: different concerns for the same individual represented in time. </p><p><graphic source="Concerns.jpg"></graphic></p><p>In the discussion that follows, the Concern Tracking Structure will be divided into four levels of function that support communications at differing levels of detail. These four levels of function include: </p><list role="unordered"><item>The attention for the Concern itself, i.e. the subject(s) of concern</item><item>Adding additional contextual information to the concern, i.e. references to additional relevant Care Statements</item><item>Using attention for a Concern to justify additional management, i.e. Concern as "Reason for an intervention"</item><item>Establishing associations with past instances of Concern in order to fully represent the Episode of Illness </item></list><p><emph role="strong">Guidance:</emph> In HL7, the Observation Class is used to communicate the perception of a state or process.  These are linked together under a concern.  In the RIM, the term Act always represents a record regarding the process of doing. Observation represents a constraint on the definition of Act that takes the form: the Act of Observation where Observation is the noun form of the infinitive "to observe." Therefore, the Act of Observation is also the recording of a process. In addition, Observation may need to be constrained further with various Act.code values in order to narrow the definition of the Act of Observation to various types of observation processes. 
</p><p>The "Attention" for a Concern is simply the idea or hypothesis that one of many potential states or processes may potentially require extra attention and management. The specific item or items of concern is represented as the "Subject or Subjects of Concern. At least one subject of concern must be present in a Concern Tracking Structure. In some implementation guides, the Subject Act Relationship may be constrained to one or a few subjects rather than a large or infinite number of subjects. All subjects of concern should be considered as a single cluster or focus of concern. A patient may have multiple concerns identified, each with a collection of subjects.
</p><p>In healthcare, the concern for the medical device, home of the patient, or other non-living subjects may need to be managed as well as the concern for the patients' bodies and wellbeing themselves. Accordingly, "concern " in this discussion is meant to be a general term referring to state of being of any entity. </p><p>The key characteristics of this Concern Act class are that it allows to link different stages in the condition of the patient / target in the following ways:</p><list role="ordered"><item>It might be possible that one patient has two different concerns that normally are unrelated; however, there might be interactions. Example: a patient with diabetes that has an accident and breaks a leg. It is not due to any diabetes related problem. Thus there will be two separate concern trackers: one for the diabetes care, another for the treatment of the fracture. Basically from the Concern Act point of view these are unrelated. In terms of instantiation of classes: the Concern Act is instantiated one time for diabetes and will get an unique class ID, and the Concern Act is instantiated a second time for the fracture and gets another - different - class ID. </item><item> It might occur that a patient has a concern and within the care for that, there is a sub-concern, requiring special attention, related to the top-level concern. For instance a woman being pregnant (the top-level concern) who has high blood pressure (the sub-concern).  A similar example would be the Concern 'Obesities' for a patient and related to this the sub concern of (risk for) Diabetes type II. We apply the Component Act relationship in the Concern Tracker structure for this.   In addition, a use case frequently occurring is to refer to a fetus' observations, e.g. fetal heart rate, but it goes in the record and messages of the pregnant woman. In that instance, the Condition of mother (patient) is pregnant, which must be linked to the sub Condition of fetus is 'unborn' and the underlying observation of the fetal heart rate.     In the COMP actRelationship, the Id of the 'Concern' and that of the 'sub-Concern' are separate and independent, and simply linked in a parent-child actRelationship.  </item><item>Some concerns exist during a period, go away for a while and come back later. Basically the concern is intermittent in nature, although the concern-related observations and diagnoses of the patient might change over time. Examples include the exacerbation of COPD, or the 'winter blues'. We can apply the Sequel (SEQL) Act Relationship for this kind of linkage between concerns.  Also this relationship is typically used to refer to an earlier pregnancy (Concern 1) during a current pregnancy (Concern 2). The concern ID's differ, but tackle a similar concern. In addition, the naming (Annotation) or underpinning (Observations) can have the same names, or values. </item><item> A concern might be the situation of the patient that evolves over time and about which different providers involved (including the patient him/herself) have matured their insight. For example a patient talking about chest pain, a general practitioner thinking about a cardiac problem, and the cardiologist diagnosing a myocardial infarction. In particular relevant is also the example of episodes of pregnancy, delivery and maternity. ELNK is intended to link different parts (episodes or periods, sometimes with different care providers and care provisions) of the same concern: e.g., link pregnancy to delivery and to maternity.    The concern tracker structure allows grouping of observations, procedures, encounters, and other acts for the particular concern, and this grouping can contain different diagnoses of different providers, all associated with the same concern. Thus, the concern is a patient-related grouper, which can be used throughout the whole care provision if the care is carried out by one professional, or to several care provisions if the care is performed by several professionals. In the above example the general practitioner has provided care and probably referred the patient to the cardiologist. The cardiologist starts his Care Provision but this can be grouped under the same concern. The test results obtained by the Cardiologist also go under this concern, thus maturing the insight in the problem the patient has.   This can be dealt with using the ELINK Episode link Act Relationship, where the id for the concern class remains the same over time, but the Act ids for the different episodes (patient himself, general practitioner, cardiologist) can differ.     In the ELINK actRelationship, each Concern' has a separate and unique identifier. </item></list><p>In particular two options: the merge and split of acts are relevant here. It might be that initially two concerns have been treated as separate instances, but need to merge into one concern. For example, evolving insights might lead to the conclusion that one was a symptom concern of the other being a disease concern. In such example the symptom concern can be grouped under the disease concern by replacing the ID of the symptom concern with the one of the disease concern. This can be done with the ELINK relationship  Similarly, if two interest, initially grouped under the same Concern (with the same ID), appear to be independent of each other, then the two concerns can be split, where best is to give each a new instance identifier, or allow one concern to be continued under the same concern ID, and the split concern getting a new ID. This is dealt with using the Replace relationship.   </p><p>These four linkage types: Component, Sequel, Episode Link and Replace are considered the use cases that are dealt with in detail in this Concern Tracking Topic. Further, there is an explanatory document attached to the Care Provision ballot materials covering much more detail and examples. </p><p>References from Concern to other Care Statements: The use of the "Reference ActRelationship" from the Concern to a Care Statement Choice Box (represented here as A_CareStatement CMET) allows the clinician to identify additional Care Statements that may be relevant to the "context of the Concern," but which cannot be truly classified as subjects of the concern. A normal lab result is an example. This "Reference ActRelationship" is especially helpful in communicating the context of the concern during the initial identification of the concern, i.e. the abductive or "hypothesis-generating" phase. Occasionally, "Reference" may be used to add important contextual information to the Concern as the understanding about the concern evolves. </p><p><emph role="strong">Reasons for Management Actions:</emph>
	The "Reason ActRelationship" is used to cite the Concern as the reason for the management action. After the nature of the Concern is established by utilizing the Subject and Reference ActRelationships, most ActRelationships associated with Concern will be used to justify the services generated to address or manage the Concern. This ActRelationship is the "Reason ActRelationship" from Care Statements back to the instance of Concern itself.
</p><p><emph role="strong">Extending and Clarifying the Episode of Illness:</emph>
	Finally, there may be a need to identify associations to other instances of the same concern. For example, after treating a concern for a period of time, a physician may discover that another physician has been treating the same concern in another institution. In this case, the first physician may wish to simply link his concern to the other physician's concern, i.e. using "EpisodeLink ActRelationship;" or he may wish to ask the other physician to obsolete the other physician's concern using the "Replace ActRelationship."
</p><p><emph role="strong">Updating the Concern Tracking Structure:</emph> Note that the specific use cases and recommendations for update semantics and instance management in general are still being developed by M&amp;M.   Consequently, specific guidance regarding the use or change of the Replace and EpisodeLink ActRelationships may evolve as HL7 as a whole nails down the details of instance management.</p><p><emph role="strong">Participations on the Concern Class: </emph>

The choice box allows expressing any collection of statements about care in any order or number, and in any kind of combination, depending on the purpose and nature of the message.   </p><p>The Care Statement Structure is the model from which all other Care Structures are derived. This derivation occurs by constraint. Based on the Clinical Statement Pattern, it is renamed the Care Statement Structure in this Domain Message Information Model for Care Provision in order to emphasize that Care may apply to medical devices, facilities, and environmental sites as well as patients. In that sense, the vocabulary used to support Care Statements is more extensive than the vocabulary used to support simply the care of patients. These extensions will be documented by a gradual increase in the number and variety of HL7 vocabulary value sets.  This description does not replicate the full details of the Clinical Statement Pattern but documents those aspects that differ significantly from the base pattern.</p><p>The intention is that a care statement instance may be added by itself to the Care Provision Act at creation of the RMIM or added at runtime execution of an application in order to support the variability of extent and detail described in the care statement definition above. Of course, the care statement may be added to the Care Provision Act along with adding the other structures of the Care Provision Domain as well.   </p><p><emph role="strong">Use of the model</emph></p><p>The Care Statement model represents a standard, high-level structure for the inclusion of clinical information in Care Provision communications intended to support specific business functions. Although not intended to be implemented 'as is', the Care Statement model can be constrained to meet the requirements of many specific communications regarding clinical information.   </p><p>Options for pattern constraint include: </p><list role="unordered"><item>The generic 'Care Statement' class attributes may be constrained to reflect the precise nature of the data to be conveyed. For example: <list role="unordered"><item>Optional attributes may be removed if not appropriate to the business case.</item><item>Attributes themselves may be constrained: <list role="unordered"><item>multiplicities may be constrained to narrower number sets, e.g. (0..*) may be constrained to (1..*)  </item><item>attribute value sets may be constrained to smaller attribute value sets, e.g. 'mood code' limited to 'Event' </item></list></item><item>Data types for an attribute may be constrained, e.g. 'ANY to CD' </item></list></item><item>Associations may be constrained to remove the potential for complexity, e.g. the limitation of an implementation to three levels of nesting; the removal of 'Episode Link' in order to define an implementation to the 'lowest common denominator' regarding system capabilities </item><item>Classes may be constrained: <list role="unordered"><item>Classes may be removed if not required </item><item>Classes may be constrained to specific subclasses, e.g. 'Observation Class' constrained to 'Vital signs Class'</item><item>Classes may be 'cloned' in order to document specific constraints on attributes or associations. </item><item>Classes with specific constraints applied may be 'unrolled' from the Clinical Statement Choice box in order to constrain their use to a specific structure (in that case, the constrained version of the class may no longer be assumed to be present in the generalized Care Statement Choice Box)  </item></list></item></list><list role="unordered"><item>Classes may be combined into specific clinical artifacts, such as combined observations in case of blood pressure or clinical scales such as Apgar score and Barthel index.</item></list><p>This model is referenced by an Act external to the Care Statements. Often, this external Act provides the 'Entry point' to a communication specification and represents the context in which the care statement information is being sent. For example, the information regarding who is sending this information is found in an Act external to the Care Statements. The Care Provision Act in the Care Provision Domain is an example of an Act external to the Care Statement. </p><p><emph role="strong">Care Statement Model  (REPC_RM000100)</emph></p><emph role="strong">Description</emph><p><emph role="strong">Model Overview </emph></p><p>The model can be divided into 3 related parts:  * CareEntry Choice Box  * Participations surrounding the Acts  * Acts outside the CareEntry Choice Box  </p><p><emph role="strong">CareEntry Choice Box</emph></p><p>This part of the model is used to convey the detailed care statements that are being sent in support of the specific business need. As well as providing a mechanism for conveying the components of this information, it supports grouping of these components and provides mechanisms to explicitly link statements where there is a specific relationship. </p><p>The class clones in the CareEntry choice are the same as those available in the Clinical Statement Pattern ActChoice. Class clone names and all aspects of the attributes are identical.</p><p><emph role="strong">Linking of Statements</emph></p><p>The modeling of the linking of Care Statements has been modified from that in the Clinical Statement Pattern as follows: </p><list role="ordered"><item>The sourceOf / targetOf relationship has been unwrapped into 2 separate relationships: sourceOf and targetOf.</item><item>The target of the new sourceOf relationship is the outer CareStatement choice</item><item> sourceOf1 has been removed </item><item>A constraint has been added to the new sourceOf relationship stating that the value of contextConductionInd must be "false" if the target is an ActReference (context cannot be conducted to ActReferences) </item></list>



This revised modeling approach provides the same semantics as that in the Clinical Statement Pattern but is considered to be a less complicated approach. <p><emph role="strong">Record Target and Subject</emph></p>



As well as applying to a patient, a Care Statement can also apply to a variety of other types of entity (eg. Equipment).  To support this, the target of the RecordTarget participation is a choice of the R_CarePatient and R_CaredEntity CMETs.  <p>Similarly, the subject of a Care Statement can be any one of several types of entity including:</p><list role="unordered"><item> the patient</item><item>another person </item><item>a specimen</item><item>a device</item><item>a facility </item><item>an environmental site</item></list><p>An extended set of roles in the SubjectChoice that is the target of the subject participation supports this requirement.   </p><emph><emph role="strong">consumable  </emph></emph><p>The consumable participation is used to bring in the Consumable Choice.

A minimum of semantic information is implied by each organizing structure. However, the implications of these minimal semantics are very important to the policies and procedures of many organizations which may use templateId and realmCode attributes to specify additional semantics.</p><p>The Statement Collector is a choice of collector Acts, ActList and ActCategory. The Component (COMP) Act Relationship is used to group Care Statements into working lists and category lists created for specific purposes and applications. The structure can represent any kind of list or grouping used in Patient Care, e.g. problems, medications, allergies, observations, activities, encounters,  and variances.  Each collector Act may have an Author. </p><p><emph role="strong">ActList </emph></p><p>The ActList is a clone of the WorkingList Act, which has the following definition:</p><p>"A dynamic list of individual instances of Act which reflects the needs of an individual worker, team of workers, or an organization to view groups of Acts for clinical and administrative reasons." Examples include problem lists, goal lists, allergy lists, and to-do lists. </p><p>The ActList represents the myriad of dynamic or managed lists found in clinical summaries such as concern lists (e.g. problem lists or allergy lists), medication lists, surgery lists, etc. </p><p>The most common uses of working lists include lists managed at the departmental level. For example, it is common in many hospital organizations for the pharmacy department to create the medication list that is used for formal medication interaction applications when a new medication is added to the list. Another example of a departmental working list is the episode of care defined by the cost accounting department for analysis of the costs related to encounters that include a specific diagnosis. In this case, the ActList collects encounters that include Act Relationships to the specific concern. </p><emph>ActList Attributes</emph><p><emph role="strong">classCode:</emph> The mandatory classCode is specified as LIST (working list), a specialization of the Act class.    </p><emph role="strong">moodCode:</emph> The mandatory moodCode used in ActList is always EVN (event). <p><emph role="strong">code: </emph>This required attribute describes a kind of WorkingList.

For Category there is a bounded list of things like "Examination", "Diagnosis" or SOAP categories. For Topic the list is wide open to any clinical concern or reason for a part of an encounter.   </p><p>The ActCategory allows Care Statements to be classified externally to the Care Statement. For example, a particular template for a summary report may require the inclusion of data within specific, required categories. This external classification scheme for clinical statements supports that requirement. This mechanism allows a positive statement that "there is no content for this classification" within the pertinent information of Care Provision.     </p><emph>ActCategory Attributes</emph><p><emph role="strong">classCode:</emph> The mandatory classCode is specified as CATEGORY, a specialization of the Organizer class under the abstract ActClassContainer sub-domain.  </p><emph role="strong">moodCode:</emph> The mandatory moodCode used in the ActCategory is always EVN (event).  <p><emph role="strong">code:</emph> This required attribute describes a kind of Category.

This model, and its accompanying diagram, is very similar to the Care Provision DMIM but uses "local CMETs" to abstract the complexity of the care structures associated with the Care Provision Request Act. The reader should refer to the DMIM discussion before reviewing the RMIM followed by the discussion for each care structure. The discussion of this model will focus on features that do not exist in the DMIM, and were not directly addressed in the review of that model.   </p><emph role="strong">CareProvisionEvent Focal Class  </emph><p>As noted in the discussion of the DMIM a Care Provision Event records and summarizes the acts relevant whilst the performer is responsible for the care provision of the target of care.   </p><emph role="strong">Associations  </emph><p>The following associations are defined for a Care Record. Each association captures the relationship between the Care Provision Event and an entity or act that plays a significant part of the Care Record.   </p><emph>Participations</emph><p>recordTarget: the record target is the entity for which the Care Record is being recorded. There can only be one record target for a Care Record. The target entity information is captured within the R_Patient CMET or R_CaredEntity local CMET. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.     </p>









subject: the subject or subjects are the target(s) of the care provision being record when the subject is not the record target. The subject information is captured within the R_Patient CMET or R_CaredEntity local CMET. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.     <p>author: the party that produces the record of a Care Provision Event. This may be an assigned person or organization (R_AssignedParty) such as a healthcare provider, a related party (R_RelatedParty) such as a family member or a non-healthcare organization, or the patient (R_Patient) themselves. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.     </p>









dataEnterer: the transcriptionist who enters the information of the Care Record. The data enterer information is captured within the R_AssignedPerson CMET.     <p>verifier: the supervisor who verifies the Care Record. There is support for more than one level of verification. The verifying party information is captured within the R_AssignedPerson CMET.     </p>









performer: the parties who take part in actually carrying out the Care Provision Event being record. There may be multiple performers because several parties may collaborate in performance of Care Provision. These parties may be an assigned person or organization (R_AssignedParty) such as a healthcare provider, a related party (R_RelatedParty) such as a family member or a non-healthcare organization, or the patient (R_Patient) themselves. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.     <p>primaryInformationRecipient: the party who is intended to receive the Care Record notification. The recipient is usually the author of the associated care transfer request or the primary care provider. These may be represented by an assigned person or organization (R_AssignedParty), a related party (R_RelatedParty) such as a family member or court, or the patient (R_Patient) themselves. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.   </p><emph>Act Relationships  </emph><p> inFullfilmentOf: this relationship links the Care Provision Event to the promise and/or request Act that it fulfills. Only the id attribute is provided to link the Act for which the Care Provision Event fulfills.     </p>









component: links the Care Provision Event to the care plan which is carried out as part of the Care Provision. Refer to A_CarePlan in the Care Structures topic for further description this local CMET.     <p>pertinentInformation1: links the Care Provision Event to the care plan which is informative in the context of the care provision but not directly relevant to this Care Record. Refer to A_CarePlan in the Care Structures topic for further description this local CMET.     </p>









pertinentInformation3: links the Care Provision Event to a set of pertinent clinical statements provided as part of the information supplied in the Care Record. Refer to A_CareStatement in the Care Structures topic for further description this local CMET.     <p>reason: a relationship to a concern recorded as the primary reason for the Care Provision. A problem, not specifically a diagnosis, which is the primary reason for the Care Provision can also be presented using this relationship. Refer to A_ConcernTracking in the Care Structures topic for further description this local CMET.     </p>









pertinentInformation2: a Care Record has a set of lists containing various Clinical Statements as relevant information, which is ongoing and not necessarily captured as part of the Care Provision Event. It may include a problem list, current medication list or a list of risk factors. Refer to A_StatementCollector in the Care Structures topic for further description this local CMET.     <p>Reference:  the Care Event or Care Events (encounter-based, episode-based, or general care-based collections) that the Care Record relates to, represented by the A_CareEvent CMET      </p>







ReplacementOf: a link to a replaced Care Record. The Care Provision Event being the target of this act relationship has a status of obsolete and can either contain just the instance identifier of the replaced Care Record or the entire Care Record information.</descriptive><rmimref role="parent" ref="REPC_DM000000UV-rmi" sectID="hmrepc" sectType="SB" refName="Care Provision" refFamiliarName="Care Provision" class="changed"

This model, and its accompanying diagram, is very similar to the Care Provision DMIM but uses "local CMETs" to abstract the complexity of the care structures associated with the Care Provision Request Act. The reader should refer to the DMIM discussion before reviewing the RMIM followed by the discussion for each care structure. The discussion of this model takes up features that do not explicitly exist in the DMIM, and were not directly addressed in the review of that model.   </p><emph role="strong">Care Provision Request Focal Class  </emph><p>As noted in the discussion of the DMIM, a Care Provision Request is a request to transfer the responsibility of Care Provision or more simply a Care Transfer Request. Typically the request is made by a clinician within an application and transmitted to the performing party via a messaging interface.   </p><p>All the participations encountered in this model have already been addressed in the discussion of the DMIM.   </p><emph role="strong">Associations </emph><p> The following associations are defined for a Care Provision Request. Each association captures the relationship between the Care Provision Request and an entity or act that plays a significant part in the Care Transfer.   </p><emph>Participations    </emph><p>recordTarget: the record target is the entity for which the Care Transfer Request is being recorded. There can only be one record target for a Care Transfer Request. The target entity information is captured within the R_Patient CMET or R_CaredEntity local CMET. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.     </p>

subject: the subject or subjects that is the target for the care transfer being requested when the subject is not the record target. The subject information is captured within the R_Patient CMET or R_CaredEntity local CMET. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.     <p>author: the party that makes the Care Transfer Request. This may be an assigned person or organization (R_AssignedParty) such as a healthcare provider, a related party (R_RelatedParty) such as a family member or court, or the patient (R_Patient) themselves. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.     </p>

dataEnterer: the transcriptionist who enters the information of the Care Transfer Request. The data enterer information is captured within the R_AssignedPerson CMET.     <p>verifier: the supervisor who verifies the request. There is support for more than one level of verification. The verifying person information is captured within the R_AssignedPerson CMET.   </p><p>performer: the party who takes part in actually carrying out the requested care provision. There may be multiple performers because several parties may collaborate in the requested care provision. This may be an assigned person or organization (R_AssignedParty) such as a healthcare provider, a related party (R_RelatedParty) such as a family member, or the patient (R_Patient) themselves.  Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.     </p>

primaryInformationRecipient: the party who is intended to receive the requested care transfer. This recipient is not the requested performer of the care provision but is receiving the request for their information. This may be an assigned person or organization (R_AssignedParty) such as a healthcare provider, a related party (R_RelatedParty) such as a family member or court, or the patient (R_Patient) themselves. Refer to the respective CMETs for further description.   <p><emph>Act Relationships   </emph></p>

Refer to A_CarePlan in the Care Structures topic for further description of this local CMET.<p>     pertinentInformation1: provides pertinent care plans to the care transfer, indicating that these are the other acts that are related but not directly requested as part of the care transfer. Refer to A_CarePlan in the Care Structures topic for further description of this local CMET.     </p>

pertinentInformation3: a set of pertinent clinical statements provided as information to support the care transfer. Refer to A_CareStatement in the Care Structures topic for further description of this local CMET.     <p>reason: relationship to a condition recorded as the primary reason for the care transfer. A problem, not specifically a diagnosis, which is the primary reason for the care transfer can also be presented using this relationship. Refer to A_ConditionTrackingEvent in the Care Structures topic for further description of this local CMET.     </p><p>component2: a collection of clinical statements can be associated as part of the Care Provision Request. This is intended to indicate that, for example, this list of conditions are being managed as part of the requested Care Transfer. Refer to A_StatementCollector in the Care Structures topic for further description of this local CMET.     </p>

pertinentInformation2: a Care Transfer Request may have relevant information that is in the form of existing Care Records, which can be attached to the Care Provision Request. Refer to the Care Record topic for further description of this local CMET.     <p>reference: the encounter in which the care transfer was requested, represented by the A_Encounter CMET.     </p>

lastEdit="2007-07-28T19:43:08"><emph role="strong">Scope and Use Cases </emph><p>Allergy and Intolerance observations are some of the most commonly recorded, reviewed and transmitted information in the medical record. Clinicians record allergies and intolerances as a way to remind themselves and other providers to avoid giving substances that are known to potentially cause harm or discomfort to the patient. The process of identifying known adverse reactions and the believed causes for them is a critical element of good clinical practice and is essential for safety and quality (Nehta).   Within the context of allergies, adverse reactions are harmful or undesirable responses after administration of an agent/substance. Intolerance is a condition where the patient has been noted to have an adverse reaction and a judgment is made that the reaction was caused by a given substance.   Administration of substances (in the form of ingestion, inhalation, injection, or direct contact) may result in adverse reactions which may be classified as severe or mild, occur after variable lengths of time, and the relationship between exposure and the adverse reaction may be uncertain. Additionally, the noted exposure may be (usually is) to a mixture of complex substances. Additionally, many substances cross react, so that it may be a class of medications that cause problems. Therefore the assignment of causality of the actual relationship between the offending substance and the reaction is generally always uncertain to some degree. </p><p><emph role="strong">Use Case 1: The clinical "Allergy" list: </emph> Many make the distinction between a true allergy and intolerance. A true allergy is a type of intolerance with where the patient's immune system "hyper" reacts after exposure to that agent/substance or a chemically similar substance. True allergies typically result in a rash or swelling and may be life threatening. They also have defined treatments such as steroids antihistamines, or epinephrine. The classic example of this is the typical penicillin allergy.   Pragmatically, both true allergies and intolerances are recorded in a separate section of the medical record. Although this section is often (usually) called "the allergy list" it more accurately represents a list of "intolerances" or "alerts" since it mixes true allergies and intolerances. Different providers will have varying opinions on the need to specifically note minor intolerances to medications such as gastric upset in this section, however there is general agreement that true allergies and severe intolerances be recorded in this section and reviewed regularly. Some severe intolerances such as heparin induced thrombocytopenia do not follow the same physiologic pathways as true allergy but follow the same need for explicit and clear warning to prescribing or administrating providers and therefore are grouped in with "allergies." Fortunately, the modeling for allergies and intolerances for this purpose does not need to include details of pathogenesis to this degree, so this mixing while technically inaccurate is of little consequence.   Logically, an allergy or intolerance is a type of medical condition or concern. It is an observation (as judged by the clinician) that asserts the patient does or does not have a condition where a substance administration is felt to be associated with an adverse reaction. It may tracked like other medical concerns as a series of observations as further clarification or understanding of the nature of that allergy occurs. For example, an observation of an allergy to percocet may be refined to a mild intolerance to "oxycodone", but tracked separately from the concern about allergy beta-lactams being refined to exclude cephalosporins.   However, there are important distinctions between most medical concerns and allergies concerns. Because they are used as specific reminders not to administer or to alter therapy, they are generally called out as a separately tracked list. Other clinical conditions and patient data may also alter therapy as well (for example dose changes based on age or renal function, or contraindications to medications in certain medical conditions) but allergies are differentiated because they are recorded as the type of therapy to avoid rather than as conditions which usually can't be avoided. Also, in many cases systems may require explicit review and specific negative assertions for various types of known allergens. For example, it is most common to see a section of a document or element of the EMR which explicitly states that the patient does not have any known allergies or any known drug allergies. The degree of granularity for specific negation is variable from specific application to application or from use case to use case. For example, many systems record explicitly that the patient is NOT allergic to Latex or IV contrast.   In general, obviously harmful substance administrations such as poisoning or overdoses are not included in allergy/intolerance lists because there should never be such an intent to treat the patient in such a manor. Similarly, seasonal or pet allergies which share many of the same underlying pathophysiology as true allergy are typically not recorded in allergy lists because there is generally not concern that these substances will be administered as therapy planning. This is not absolute, however as some physicians do prefer to track environmental allergies in this section. Food allergies on the other hand, generally are included in this list since diets may be ordered or prescribed and many medications or immunizations may include food substances, however. Most notably many immunizations are grown in eggs.   </p><emph role="strong">Data Capture:  </emph>Allergies/Intolerance lists are typically reviewed at many points of patient care. For example, physicians typically review patient allergies when they first see a patient or perform History and Physicals. Nurses typically have a similar intake assessment where allergies are reviewed as do pharmacists. Typical use patterns typically involve a review rather than capture of new allergies because allergy information is considered to be important by a wide variety of people and so it is frequent that some records are available which provide this information. For example, a nurse may review a list of the patients allergies from transfer records when he/she does their intake assessment, and a physician may review the nurses list with the patient when he/she does their history and physical.   It is also common that allergy lists are reviewed and updated in the course of care when new information is available. For example, it may be noted that the patient has a new suspect allergy when noted to have an adverse reaction after exposure to a medication. Similarly there is often review and correction a result of need to challenge the certainty that the allergy exists. For example an allergy to Penicillin may be noted. This may persist for quite some time before the patient actually needs antibiotics, and further questioning may reveal that the reaction happened many years ago and that patient is unsure about specifically what happened. Cautious trials of therapy or even further verification testing may proceed as a result. Additional clarification details may be appended such as "patient has tolerated cephalosporins in the past" (i.e. cross reactivity has been ruled out) or the allergy may even be marked as erroneous.   Allergies and some intolerances may be supported by evidence such as allergy sensitivity testing or serology tests.   <p><emph role="strong">Data Use:  </emph>Allergy information is useful for a variety of use cases. First, and importantly, it is used in the simple human review of allergy information. Patients may forget or may be unable to indicate allergy information. Indeed, even the same provider may have difficulty remembering a patients allergies as the patient moves through the continuity of care. As a result, allergy information is usually provided from provider to provider on any patient transfer of care, discharge, or referral. This occurs through paper documents, simple storage in an EMR where both clinicians share the same EMR, or exchange between clinical information systems when the clinicians use different systems. Electronic transfer of this information may be either through structured documents, messages, or queries depending on particular use cases and or system capabilities.   Allergy data always includes some representation of the allergen, however also should ideally include the reaction with or without severity. It may include additional details including when the event occurred or supporting details. The data capture is often incomplete, however, and even the allergen may be at a hazy level of granularity. For example, the patient may only remember that they are allergic to a "-cillins" (several different types of antibiotics)   Allergy information needs to be codified and computer processable since many systems use and exchange allergy data for the expressed purpose of drug order to allergy checks, and may require allergy information to be assessed. Many systems also require statements about the status allergy review within a given time period, thus it is important to include even updates even when the assertion is simply to repeat that no allergies are known to exist.   In some cases allergy information is used for reporting to external agencies.   </p><p><emph role="strong">Walk-Through</emph></p><p>This is a walk through of a generic allergy/intolerance model, which can be constrained to record and list a patient's allergy or intolerances to various levels of agent/substance hierarchy, as well as to more generic concepts such as food and the environment.

</item><item>Participation to "EHR Repository" (custodian1)</item><item>Participation to "Record Location" (custodian2)</item><item>Participation to "Service Delivery Location" (location)</item><item>The "Has Predecessor" ActRelationship to an Old Procedure Event  describing Id of the record it succeeded (predecessor)</item><item>The "Has Successor" ActRelationship to a New Procedure Event containing the Id of the succeeding record (successor)</item><item>The "Has Subject Of" ActRelationship to Annotation Indicator signifying whether or not there are annotations attached to the professional service record (subjectOf2)</item><item>The "Is Component Of" ActRelationship to WorkingListEvent describing category of the service (componentOf1)</item><item>The " Subject Of" ActRelationship to DocumentEvent containing the Id of the referenced Service Report (subjectOf3)</item><item>The "Is Subject Of" ActRelationship to A_Annotation CMET (subjectOf1) containing comments that have been made about the professional service record</item><item>The "Has Reason" ActRelationship to A_SupportingClinicalInformation CMET (reason) containing clinical information to support the need for the service</item><item>The "Is Component Of" ActRelationship to A_Encounter CMET indicating the clinicall event group to which this professional service is linked(componentOf2) </item><item>The "Is Fulfillment Of" ActRelationship to ActRequest indicating the  prior request for which this professional is fulfilling (inFulfillmentOf) </item></list><p><emph role="strong">Participations</emph></p><p>author (provider):  This identifies the provider who is responsible for the decision to capture the Professional Service in the patient's EHR. Note that while the author is frequently the data-enterer, this will not always be the case, for example where transcribers are involved.</p><p>performer (Provider):  Identifies the person(s) who actually performed the action described in the record.</p><p>responsibleParty (Provider):  This identifies the person that has primary responsibility for the actions of the author in creating the Professional Service. The supervising provider is not necessarily present when the action is performed, but is professionally accountable for the action through the power to delegate, and the duty to review actions with the performing actor after the fact.</p><p>subject (Patient):  This identifies the patient associated with the Professional Service record.</p><p>informant (Provider, Patient, or RelatedParty): In the case where the information in the record is being captured second-hand, this identifies the source of the information. If not specified, it is assumed that the author is capturing information of which they have first-hand awareness.</p><p>custodian1:  This indicates the EHR repository the Professional Service record is stored in.</p><p>custodian2:  This indicates the physical facility where the Professional Service record is stored. This is generally the same as the location where the action was performed, but in some cases may be different. (E.g. where the action was done at the patient's home, but the data is captured and stored in the clinician's clinic. Used to indicate where records are likely kept for follow-up.</p><p>location:  This identifies the location where the Professional Service actually occurred. E.g. Patient's residence, clinic, work site, etc.</p><p><emph role="strong">ActRelationships</emph></p><p>predecessor:  Identifies any records that are "superseded" by the current record. This will cause the referenced records to be marked as "obsolete" with a reference pointing to this record. Used in circumstances where information initially captured about an event is erroneous, incomplete or not captured at the desired level of detail and the change cannot be made by retracting the original record</p><p>successor:  Identifies the record that supersedes the current record. This attribute is set when a new record identifies the current record as being replaced. Used in circumstances where a newer or corrected version of the record of this event exists.</p><p>subjectOf2:  This association provides an indication that there are notes/comment records associated with the Professional Service record. Used to show whether additional information is available on further drill-down.</p><p>subjectOf4:  Describes information associated with status change for the professional service record.</p><p>componentOf1:  Describes the categorization of the service. E.g. Psychological Counseling, Smoking Cessation, Cardiac Surgeries, etc.</p><p>subjectOf3:  Indicates an identifier for a report associated with the professional service.</p><p>subjectOf1:  This indicates comments that providers have recorded about the Professional Service.</p><p>reason:  Identifies the clinical reason(s) for performing the action described by the record. Essential for understanding the context in which the action was performed.</p><p>component2:  This identifies the encounter-based, condition-based and/or other care-based collections that  the Professional Service is considered to be part of. Care compositions (defined by A_CaredEntity CMET) provide a means of navigating a patient's EHR by grouping related records together into identified "collections"". </p><p>inFulfillmentOf:  This ties the record to the request (referral or specific request) that resulted in the creation of the Professional Service record. By requesting the action, a provider takes a level of responsibility for it. Also, a link between request and fulfilling record may result in differences in query responses.</p><p><emph role="strong">Professional Service R-MIMs</emph></p><p>The specific messages defined for the recording or listing of professional services may be slightly constrained versions of the generic professional service structures described above.  Following is the list of professional service RMIMs, identifying the those components of the professional service generic structure that have been constrained out: </p><p>	REPC_RM610001 - Professional Service Record	</p><p>This is the message payload for recording professional service for the first time. Thus, the following is a list of deviations from the full complement of professional service structure as described above:</p><list role="unordered"><item>Service Record Id (ProcedureEvent.Id) is not specified</item><item>Author and ResponsibleParty participations are constrained out (sent in message as part of ControlActWrapper)</item><item>The 'Replaced by Record' class is not specified</item><item>Cardinality of the subjectOf1 actRelationship is set to [0..1]</item><item>Service Category (WorkingListEvent) is not specified</item></list><p>REPC_RM610002 - Professional Service List</p><p>This is the message payload for a response to a query for a patient's professional service summary information. This message comprises the full complement of classes, association, participations and attributes as described above for the generic Professional Service message structure. </p><p> REPC_RM610004 - Professional Service List Query</p><p>This is not a constrained version of the generic Professional Service message structure. Rather, it is a message that identifies the various parameters that act as filters on the records to be retrieved. Allows the user and/or the point-of-service application to constrain what Professional Service information they wish to retrieve.

The purpose of this structure is to define the management action plans for the various conditions identified for the target of care. It is the structure in which the care planning for all individual professions or for groups of professionals can be organized, planned and checked for completion. Communicating explicitly documented and planned actions and goals greatly aids the team in understanding and coordinating the actions that need to be performed for the person. Care plans also permit the monitoring and flagging of unperformed activities and unmet goals for later follow up.</p>



























The term Patient Care Planning in MESH is described as:<p>Usually a written medical and nursing care program designed for a particular patient. Year introduced: 1968"</p><p>The basic theory underlying this structure comes from Larry Weeds Problem-oriented Medical Record, also introduced in the 1960s, which is used by many health professions and electronic health record systems as a primary method for organizing work and documentation.</p><emph role="strong">Phases of Care Plans and Guidelines: </emph>Essential to many Care Plans and Guidelines is the concept of sequential "Phases" or stages. These phases of the Care Plan are to be modeled using recursive component ActRelationship on the focal act of Care Provision. Each component phase is then considered a mini-guideline or mini-care plan. Typical phases include those defined by nursing practice, e.g. assessment, plan, performance and evaluation; or those defined by organizational practice, e.g. pre-operative, operative, post-operative recovery, post-operative rehabilitation, etc. (see Figure 1) The decision support tools discussed below govern entrance and exit logic from these mini-guidelines and care plans. <p>Figure 1 The Care Plan builds upon the collection of Observations that are expressed in the Care Statement structure and usually are organized in the Statement Collector, both structures of the Care Provision D-MIM. Following one to many observations a clinician will determine a diagnoses and from there can set outcomes, define care activities and implement these. Outcomes can be observed at any point during the care. </p><p><diagref ref="REPC_NA000046.gif">Link to wide graphic (opens in a new window)</diagref></p><p>Figure 2. Figure 2 below describes the dynamics of the care process, which is usually documented in the care record. To support the documentation of each of the components of the care process and to facilitate the exchange of data, the HL7 v3 Care Plan structure REPC_RM000200 has been developed. </p><diagref ref="REPC_NA000054.gif">Link to wide graphic (open in a new window)</diagref><p>Care Process. (Goossen W, Ozbolt J, Coenen A, Park HA, Mead C, Ehnfors M, Marin H. (2004). Development of a provisional domain model for the nursing process for use within the Health Level 7 RIM.  J Am Med Inform Assoc., 11 (3): 186-194. http://www.jamia.org/cgi/content/short/M1085v1).</p><emph role="strong">  Scope of Responsibility: </emph><p>The Care Provision Structure is attached to the Care Provision Act in two ways. As components of the Care Provision Act, the Care Plans reflect part of the scope of responsibility (a component of the care delivery) defined by the Care Provision Act (see the Care Provision Domain narrative). Component is more specific than pertinent. It says that one act is part of another act. In this case, planning for future care is "part of" the delivery of care, which is the focal class. As pertinent information to the Care Provision Act, the Care Plans are used by the receiver to make sure that orders are checked for interactions and not duplicated or mistakenly discontinued by the receiver.</p>



























For example, if a request is made to a receiver to answer a particular question on the care of a particular disease, that question may be expressed within a Care Plan request. A particular question may be asked of the receiver of the request to fill in the observation.value field and/or the observation.text field or other relevant fields in an instance of observation. To further illustrate this example; the patient may have a cardiac valve replacement and be anti-coagulated on coumadin. The patient may also be pregnant, which is noted as pertinent information. A cardiologist may be asked for the highest acceptable Protime INR value that would limit bleeding in the pregnancy but still give protection for the valve replacement. In this case, the component care plan would identify the cardiac valve replacement as the reason for the care plan. The Care Plan Class instance would be in request mood. The observation.mood would be goal request; the observation.code would code the Protime test; and, as in all requests, the values for the acceptable INR range are not included, indicating that they should be filled in by the cardiologist (see Table 1).   <p>Table 1:  Attribute values for class instances in Care Plan Request</p><p><diagref ref="REPC_NA000043.gif">Link to wide graphic (opens in a new window) </diagref></p><p>In addition, the cardiologist may add a schedule of protime tests in proposal mood to the care plan and include recommended medication adjustments for the various INR values that might be obtained from the protime measurements (see the section on Decision Support below). </p><emph role="strong">Moods and States of Care Plans and Guidelines: </emph>The difference between the Guideline Class and the Care Plan Class is the difference in concept between a Guideline, which is "a general list of actions that are defined to be applied to all appropriate targets of care when certain pre-conditions are met" versus the Care Plan, which is "the specific list of actions that are intended to be applied to a specific target of care." Therefore, the mood code of Guidelines is Definition Mood, and the mood code of Care Plans is Intent Mood and its children moods (See table 2). <p>Table 2: Children of Intent Mood (link to ActMood file in RIM) </p><diagref ref="REPC_NA000044.gif">Link to wide graphic (opens in a new window)</diagref><p>A Request would be used to ask a consultant to recommend a care plan. Proposal would be used by a consultant recommending a Care Plan. Intent itself would be used to activate a care plan. Care plans may be scheduled in Appointment mood. For each mood, several states are valid, in particular the states of "active" and "completed. The one or more care plan instances in a given communication potentially contain any acts included in the Care Statement Structure.</p>



























Typically, a specific Care Plan will have actions added or taken away from the list of actions in a Guideline, often referred to as Care Plan variations. In relationship to clinical pathways, such variations are normally documented in order to measure the variances on populations of patients, which can be used to improve the guidelines. For the purpose of clarity within the Care Plan Structure, variation is defined here as something that is different from a standard (i.e., the Guideline), where variance is a statistical measure of dispersion, or a calculated degree of variation (How much does this patient differ compared to a group of similar patients). Of course the reasons for these Care Plan variations include the presence of co-morbidities, judgments of the clinician, non-consent of a patient, and other reasons described in the disease management literature.   <p>Often, in a Care Provision communication, the Guideline is named simply as a reference to an external guideline without specifically representing all the Care Statements implied by the Guideline. However, other business needs may require that all the Care Statements that exist in a specific Guideline definition be specifically communicated as well. It should go without saying that in a Care Provision communication, the Care Statements collected by a Guideline need to be kept completely separate for patient safety reasons from Care Statements collected by a Care Plan. However, it is important to be able to document the variation between what the Guideline (in Definition Mood) states should be done, and what according to the Care Statements has actually been done (Any Act in Event Mood). In the Care Plan RMIM, what "has been done" is documented in the "fulfillment" ActRelationship from Care Statements CMET to the Care Plan choice box.</p><emph role="strong">Additional Classes:</emph> Participations follow the general model for Care Provision Domain as a whole. Reason for the Care Plan is represented by the Reason ActRelationship associated to the disease Condition. Goals and the other Predicate moods (Event.Criterion and Option) may be applied to the whole care plan as well as to component phases of the care plan (see Table 3). <p><emph role="strong">Table 3: Predicate Moods (link to ActMood file in RIM)</emph></p><diagref ref="REPC_NA000045.gif">Link to wide graphic (opens in a new window)</diagref><p><emph role="strong">Moods and States of Care Plan Components: </emph>As mentioned above, Care Plans are collectors of Care Statements. Like the Care Plan itself, these Care Statements collected by the Care Plan will have moods of either Intent or the children of Intent. However, like any Care Statements in the Intent moods, instances of these Care Statements will be created as the Act concept moves through the downstream stages of the business cycle of Acts, e.g. Events. As mentioned above, the Fulfillment ActRelationships to the Care Plan component Acts represents the downstream instances in the Act business cycle.</p>



























Between the use of Definition mood in the Guideline Class Components, the Intent moods in the Care Plan Class Components, the Acts in Predicate moods related to the Care Plans and Components, and the Fulfillment Acts, all the options for moodCode can be used in the Care Plan Structure, thus giving an overview on the dynamics of a whole set of (specialized) Acts planned or performed during Care Provision. Clinician thus can track the status of their work carried out on behalf of Patients or other Targets of Care.<p><emph role="strong">Goals in Care Plans: </emph>Goals are common within Care Plan phases, and often must be met in order to move a patient from one phase of a Care Plan to another. For example, for a patient to move from the post-operative recovery room to a surgical floor bed, certain vital signs must be stable. Whether these goals are considered met or not met may depend on clinician judgment or on decision support rules stored in Observation.derivationExpr. A typical goal is expressed as an Observation scheduled for some time in the future with a particular value in the observation.value field. For example, a rule may state that the observation of a heart rate between 60 and 100 must be present at the time of discharge from recovery. A Care Plan may identify this heart rate as a goal for 30 minutes after entry to the recovery unit. </p><emph role="strong">Order Sets in Care Plans:</emph> Order sets can organize and structure complex health care plans into useful units of work for clinicians. An order within an order set can request any clinical activity including referrals (requests for encounters), acts, supplies, procedures and observations among others. Structured observations and goal setting can also be supported from the order set. The sharing of care protocols and regimes authored as phased order sets has a much broader audience for work on error reduction, standardization of care and quality improvement. Order sets in this context can be envisioned as action elements within a care plan, allowing a clinician to organize and request a step in a larger protocol.   <p>Definition of the structure and function of orders and order sets for an implementation-independent EHR referred to as the virtual medical record (vMR) is a central issue in development of interoperable functionality necessary to publicaly published guidelines that may be used by multiple institutions. HL7 Clinical Decision Support Technical Committee is in the process of describing a multi-layered standard that supports the publication and maintenance of order set libraries, the sharing of order sets between collaborating institutions, the structuring of order sets to support effective clinical use, and the interoperation of order sets within advanced clinical guideline support software. Organizations employing this standard would deploy the depth of specification appropriate to their enterprise needs and the capabilities of their clinical systems architecture and performance.</p>



























Within a specific phase or order set, the detail of how care is intended to be delivered is expressed. This detail includes the expression of goals and measurements of outcomes after interventions are applied. Order sets specifically include particular sequences of orders and decision support rules, including rules for stopping or revising orders and rules for entering or exiting the current order set in order to enroll the patient in a new phase of the care plan.<p><emph role="strong">Clinical Decision Support Rules in Care Plans: </emph>Management of the flow between phases of a care plan is implemented via decision support rules expressed in instances of the observation class.. These rules, in whatever decision support language is used, may be expressed in the Observation.derivationExpr attribute in the observation class included as a component of the current phase of a Care Plan. Typically the rule evaluates current observations on the patient against goals expressed for the current phase of care and determines whether the patient is ready to move on to the next phase of care.</p>



























Further guidance on the use of these decision support languages will be published by the HL7 Clinical Decision Support Technical Committee. Examples used in Care Provision models include expressions as simple as formulae for calculations, such as summing up a total score, or as complicated as making a choice between two potential actions based on decision criteria expressed in the derivation expression logic syntax.<p><emph role="strong">Care Plan Structure Walk-through:</emph></p><emph role="strong">CarePlan Focal Class:</emph>The Care Plan Structure's focal class act represents the care plan.<p><emph role="strong">classCode: </emph>The vocabulary domain specified for Act.classCode includes PCPR (Patient Care Provision) as a specialization of the Act class.</p><emph role="strong">moodCode: </emph>The Care Plan Act may be expressed in many moods. These moods distinguish the different aspects of the business lifecycle of a Care Plan Act. These moods for the Care Plan are defined as follows:



<table border="1" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>DEF (definition)</td><td>Definition mood code can be used to express a guideline or protocol.  This can include treatment protocols, standardized care plans, clinical pathways or similar.</td></tr><tr><td><p>INT (intent)</p></td><td><p> Intent can be used to express the intended activities in a care plan. In particular the appropriate selection of observations and activities from a guideline that are included in the care plan for one particular patient. So the intended Acts are individualized from the guideline.   </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>GOL (Goal)   </p></td><td><p>Expectation to make a specific observation with a desired value at a predefined future time.   </p><p>In the clinical pathway, the goal can be put against the actual value (the observation in event mood). If there is a difference, it is the individual variation of the patient against the goal. If a population of patients is measured against the goal, and the average is calculated, it is the variance.  </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>RQO (request) </p></td><td><p> A "Care Plan Request" is a question to another care provider regarding their ability to accept the responsibility of a Care Plan for the subject. A Request would be used for instance to ask a consultant to recommend a care plan. The scope of responsibility including CareProvision.code, reasons for care provision, and component care plans that set the specific expectations for care apply to the scope of responsibility for the receiver of the request.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PRP (Proposal)</p></td><td><p>Proposal would be used by a consultant recommending a Care Plan. Intent itself would be used to activate a care plan. Care plans may be scheduled in Appointment mood.  </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ActMoodPredicate </p></td><td><p>Any of the above service moods (e.g., event, intent, or goal) can be turned into a predicate used as a criterion to express conditionals (or queries.) However, currently we allow only criteria on service events.      </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><emph role="strong">   id:</emph> This attribute identifies a particular Care Plan.      </p><emph role="strong">derivationExpr:</emph> The derivation expression attribute allows a string expression on derivation and is supported in an observation instance. It is used in Care Plan to give instructions (Definition mood), or to explain how a value has been determined (event mood). Examples often used include the summing up of individual scores to a sumscore, e.g. for the Apgar score or Barthel index.     <p><emph role="strong">title:</emph> One title can be given to the Care Plan in free generated text. This can be done in the definition mood to refer to a guideline or pathway, and in the intent mood to refer to a particular care plan for a target.     </p><emph role="strong">statusCode</emph>: The statusCode attribute is used to indicate the current state of the Care Plan. The statusCode attribute corresponds to the Act state machine and for the Care Plan has the following valid values:     <table border="1" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><p>Code </p></td><td><p> Definition </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>active </p></td><td><p>The care plan can be performed or is being performed.   </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>suspended</p></td><td><p>An care plan that has been activated (actions could or have been performed against it), but has been temporarily disabled. No further action should be taken against it until it is resumed.  </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>completed</p></td><td><p>  A care plan that has terminated normally after all of its constituents have been performed.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>aborted </p></td><td><p>The care plan has been terminated prior to the originally indended completion.  </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>obsolete </p></td><td><p> This care plan has been replaced by a new instance, e.g., due to changes, goals not met etc.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>nullify</p></td><td><p>This care plan was created in error and has been 'removed' and is treated as though it never existed. A record is retained for audit purposes only. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The other attributes have the common Act attributes characteristics that are explained in detail at the D-MIM level.   </p><emph role="strong">Participations from Care Plan  </emph><p>The Care Plan focal class has several participations to R_AssignedPerson, R_AssignedParty and R_AssignedEntity. These have similar meaning as in the D-MIM and are explained there.   </p><p>Important here however is that the R_AssignedEntity in the author participation can be the patient her or himself. This for those instances that patients regulate their own treatment and / or care.   </p>

















Further, the Performer participation uses the functionCode to distinguish between the Care Coordinator and other care team members. We do need new ParticipationFunction code for Care Coordinator.  <emph role="strong">Component Relationship</emph><p>  The component relationship from Care Plan Act to itself functions to phasing the care plan trough the different phases.   </p><emph role="strong">Guideline Act Relationship </emph><p> The focal class Care Plan has a Definition relationship to the Guideline Class. The type code of the Act Relationship is INST (instantiates). It is used in the context of the Care Plan to  capture the link between the Guideline (the master part) and the actual service, where this is the actual care plan for a particular patient. The instantiation in the Care Plan may override the Guidelines contents via removing, altering or adding to the care plan.   </p><emph role="strong">Guideline </emph><p> The Guideline's attributes are similar to the Care Plan except for the mood code which is always in DEF (Definition) and the text attribute that allows to give full written explanations about the guideline, e.g. the scientific evidence for it's use, reference to the literature, and instructions for a professional how to deal with it.   </p>

















The guideline has an author participation with R_AssignedEntity who is responsible for the content.   <p>The guideline has also a component relationship to link different instances of the guideline together or to link different components from the guideline choice box.   </p>

















{Future work of PC TC here will include a structure that allows the variation tracking on individual level and variance analysis on population level of of yes / no adhering to Guideline and how. This includes the adding or removing and stating the reason why the change is made.}  <p><emph role="strong">Guideline Component Relationship</emph></p>

















This kind of relationship has been explained at D-MIM level and is used here in the standard way. A guideline can consist of several components from the Defined Care choice box.<p><emph role="strong">Defined Care choice box.</emph></p>

















This choice box holds several of the classes of the Care Statement structure. All instances in the Defined Care Choice Box have the mood code Definition (DEF).   <p><emph role="strong">Patient Instructions </emph></p>

















This act Patient Instructions holds the relevant instructions for the patient that are derived from or associated with the guideline and the guidelines. The attributes are similar to generic act.   <p>{The class code PROC is subject to change given ongoing discussions on this matter}  </p><emph role="strong">Final Goal </emph><p> Via the final ActRelationship the Act Class ObservationGoal is associated to the Care Plan. The function of the ObservationGoal is to set goals in the Care Plan. It works like this: If an Observation at a point in time (that is expressed in a care statement observation) has a particular value, the clinician can state a better value as goal and Plan activities in the Care Plan to achieve the goal and thus to improve the situation for the patient. Alternatively, the Guideline on which the Care Plan can be based can state a reference value for a particular observation and the ObservationGoal can be used to define that in the Care Plan for the individual patient (Target).   </p>

















In the event mood of this observation (that is then the 2nd instantiation for this observation, where goal is the 1st), the actual value is present and can be compared to the ObservationGoal value. The variation can also be determined, which is a third instantiation of the observation, related to the goal and to the actual value.<p><emph role="strong">   PlannedCare Choice Box</emph></p>

















The PlannedCare choice box is connected to the Care Plan via a component relationship, indicating that a care plan can have 0 to many components in it.   <p>In the Planned Choice box, all the different Act classes are in Intent mood (INT) to indicate what activities, observations, encounters, and substance administrations, etc. are planned in the Care Plan for an individual.   </p>

















The PlannedCare choice box has an inFulfillment Act relationship with the Guideline choicebox. This can be used to determine that an act in the PlannedCare choice box fulfills the suggested act in the guideline.   <p>{Future work for the Care Plan will include further expression of the exact mechanics for this relationship, including the explanations for it, and the changes of moods and acts status}.   </p><emph role="strong">Criterion</emph><p>  The PlannedCare choice box has a act relationship named 'conditions' to the Act Criterion.  The function of Criterion is explained in depth elsewhere in the D-MIM. It functions here in a similar way: to set limits and criteria to particular acts.   </p><emph role="strong">Material </emph><p> Via the consumable participation the SubstanceAdministrationIntent Act class in the PlannedCare choice box has a direct link to the Role Choicebox Material, in which the roles AdministrableMaterial and Medication can be selected and thus the Entity MaterialKind and via the MaterialPart role to MaterialKind2. MaterialKind is constrained to class codes PART or INGR (ingredient) It functions similarly as in the Care Statement and allows to determine in the Care Plan what substance should be given at what time.  </p><emph role="strong"> ConditionTracking</emph><p>  Via the 'reason' relationship the PlannedCare choice box is linked to the ConditionTracking CMET.  </p><emph role="strong">Care Statement</emph><p>  The Care Statement (as CMET expressed here to link to the whole structure in the R-MIM) is linked to the PlannedCare choice box via the fulfillment relationship. This functions such that the planned care acts in intent mood and the care statement acts that are in event mood are linked to each other.    </p>

















The moodcode of the Care Statement here is constrained to INT.  <p><emph role="strong">ObservationGoal </emph></p>

















Similar to the Care Plan Act, the Goal Observation is linked to the PlannedCare choice box (as a shadow). Its function is the same here as described above for Care Plan.     <p><emph role="strong">Planned Review </emph></p>

















In clinical care, a care plan is reviewed regularly. This can be done on ad hoc basis, e.g. based on changes in the condition of the patient, or when particular observations are present as care statement. However, it is also possible to have a predetermined review of the care plan. For example in elderly care, the care plan will not change very often, but still would require an annual or 6 month review.   <p>The class code is REV for review, the mood is Intent and the effective time is the date of the reassessment.  </p><emph role="strong"> Performer   </emph><p>The AssignedPerson that carries out the acts from the PlannedCare choice box is linked to it via the Performer participation.   </p><emph role="strong">Annotation  </emph><p>It is possible to add annotations to the Care Plan via the subject of relationship.   Annotation in relation to PlannedCare has an Act class code, the EVN moodcode, the text attribute to document the annotation and the statuscode is completed to indicate that the annotation is ready.   </p>

















Annotation has also an author (shadow from the author of the Care Plan).    <p><emph role="strong">Contained Hierarchical Message Descriptions </emph></p>
