                  <p>Welcome to the 2008 Normative Edition of the Version 3 (V3) messaging standard. This package is the result of many years of
                     work within the HL7 community and an increasingly focused effort with each new publication cycle. We believe it is a major
                     step forward for global health information standards.
                  </p>
                  <p>The document you are currently reading is the Package Note to Readers document, which contains the following sections:</p>
                  <p><a href="#bbintro">HL7 Organizational Overview</a></p>
                  <p>The HL7 Introduction section provides a brief overview of the HL7 Organization, its mission and philosophy.</p>
                  <p><a href="#bbv3int">HL7 Version 3 Overview</a></p>
                  <p>Review this section to understand what HL7 V3 is, why we developed HL7 V3, and the principles underlying the V3 Standard.</p>
                  <p><a href="#bbstart">Getting Started</a></p>
                  <p>The V3 Publication is composed of two types of documents: Foundation and Domain.  The Foundation documents are those documents
                     that are broader in scope and tend to apply to all domain documents.  The V3 Guide, the HL7 Vocabulary Domain and Reference
                     Information Model, for example, are Foundation documents.  Domain documents are produced for a specific domain such as pharmacy
                     or scheduling and contain the messages relevant to that domain.
                  </p>
                  <p>Below is a graphical representation of the Foundation documents.</p>
                  <p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/bb_Backbone.gif" alt="graphics/bb_Backbone.gif" /><br /><br /></p>
                  <p>Version 3 Domains contain specifications for dealing with functional areas of healthcare. For example, Patient Administration,
                     or Medical Redords.

                  <p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/bb_backbone_3.gif" alt="graphics/bb_backbone_3.gif" /><br /><br /></p>
                  <p>Each Domain document has a common structure and contains a common set of artifacts.</p>

                                 3 software when accessing terminological content.  The Resource Location and Updating Service (RLUS) defines a set of interfaces

                                 mechanisms.  The Entity Identification Service (EIS) provides a set of capabilities to manage and retrieve identifying information
                                 for various kinds of entities (people, organizations, devices, etc.) thereby providing a foundation component for many healthcare
                                 interoperability scenarios.  The Decision Support Service (DSS) defines a service functional model for a service that can
                                 be queried by a DSS client.  Conceptually, a DSS is a 'guardian' of one or modules of medical knowledge capable of utilizing
                                 coded patient data to arrive at machine-interpretable conclusions regarding the patient information under consideration. 
                                 The Service Oriented Architecture and HL7 V3 Methodology document defines an approach for implementing healthcare services
                                 within the Healthcare Services Specification Project (HSSP), but provides an additional interim method of defining and implementing

                     <div class="body">
                        <p>HL7 is one of several ANSI-accredited Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) operating in the healthcare arena. Most SDOs
                           produce standards (sometimes called specifications or protocols) for a particular healthcare domain such as clinical data,
                           pharmacy, medical devices, imaging or insurance (claims processing) transactions. Health Level Seven's domain is clinical
                           and administrative data.
                        </p>
                        <p>HL7 is a not-for-profit volunteer organization. Its members - providers, vendors, payers, consultants, government groups,
                           pharmaceutical and others who have an interest in the development and advancement of clinical and administrative standards
                           for healthcare - develop the standards. Like all ANSI-accredited SDOs, HL7 adheres to a strict and well-defined set of operating
                           procedures that ensure consensus, openness and balance of interest. A frequent misconception about HL7 (and presumably about
                           the other SDOs) is that it develops software. In reality, Health Level Seven develops specifications, the most widely used
                           being a messaging standard that enables disparate healthcare applications to exchange key sets of clinical and administrative
                           data.
                        </p>
                        <p>The HL7 Working Group is composed of volunteers who give their time on a personal basis or under sponsorship of their employers.
                           Membership in the HL7 Working Group has been, and continues to be, open to anyone wishing to contribute to the development
                           and refinement of the HL7 standards.

                     <div class="body">
                        <p>The term "Level 7" refers to the highest level of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model of the International Organization
                           for Standardization (ISO). This is not to say that HL7 conforms to ISO defined elements of the OSI's seventh level. Also,
                           HL7 does not specify a set of ISO approved specifications to occupy layers 1 to 6 under HL7's abstract message specifications.
                           HL7 does, however, correspond to the conceptual definition of an application-to-application interface placed in the seventh
                           layer of the OSI model.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the OSI conceptual model, the functions of both communications software and hardware are separated into seven layers, or
                           levels. The HL7 Messaging Standard is primarily focused on the issues that occur within the seventh, or application, level.
                           These are the definitions of the data to be exchanged, the timing of the exchanges, and the communication of certain application-specific
                           errors between the applications. However, of necessity, protocols that refer to the lower layers of the OSI model are sometimes
                           mentioned to help implementers understand the context of the standard. They are also sometimes specified to assist implementers
                           in establishing working HL7-based systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>The standard does not try to assume a particular architecture with respect to the placement of data within applications, but
                           is designed to support a central patient care system as well as a more distributed environment where data resides in departmental
                           systems. Rather than addressing specific issues of application architecture, HL7 serves as a way for inherently disparate
                           applications and data architectures operating in a heterogeneous system environment to communicate with each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>If we consider the multitude of healthcare information systems applications as well as the variety of environments in which
                           healthcare is delivered, it is evident that there are many more interfaces which could benefit from standardization. The interfaces
                           chosen were considered to be of high priority by the members participating in the standards writing process. HL7's intent
                           is to prepare a complete standard for these interfaces, built on a generic framework that is sufficiently robust to support
                           many other interfaces.

                     <div class="body">
                        <p>HL7 V3, like V2.x, is a standard for exchanging messages among information systems that implement healthcare applications.
                           However, V3 strives to improve the V2 process and its outcomes. The original process for defining HL7 messages was established
                           in 1987. It has served well since. However, as HL7 membership grew and its standards became more widely used, HL7 has become
                           aware of opportunities to revolutionize healthcare interface computing. HL7 interfaces substantially reduce costs and implementation
                           times when compared to the industry's experience with proprietary interfaces. However, these costs and times vary considerably
                           by vendor, and the industry sees a need for improvement. Substantial optionality in HL7 makes it difficult to specify precise
                           contract terms for HL7 interfaces. This can lead to unrealistic expectations that hurt vendors and buyers equally. The development
                           principles behind HL7 V3 lead to a more robust, fully specified standard.

                           <div class="body">
                              <p>The HL7 V2.x development process is entirely ad hoc. There is no explicit methodology. Members receive no formal guidance
                                 in constructing messages. Trigger events and data fields are described solely in natural language. The structural relationships
                                 among data fields are not clear. Segments are reused in many messages and message definitions are reused for many trigger
                                 events. In order to accommodate this extensive reuse, most data fields are optional. Chapters are inconsistent in their use
                                 of trigger events versus status codes. There is no specification as to when a specific kind of healthcare information system
                                 should be expected to honor a trigger event or accept a message.
                              </p>
                              <p>With V2.x, a Work Group creates messages by editing word processing documents directly. The metadata is not available in a
                                 structured form until the staff and volunteers tediously extract it from the word processing documents after publication.
                              </p>
                              <p>In summary, there is substantial need to improve this old process in order to handle the breadth and complexity of the challenges
                                 HL7 faces today. Our industry will benefit because this new process results in a more rigorous specification.

                              <p>Fortunately, software practitioners have learned a lot since 1987. There are better methodologies. Computer support is far
                                 more available and cost-effective. However, HL7 cannot take advantage of these developments solely by minor tweaks to the
                                 old process.

                              <p>HL7 spent four years characterizing its revised goals and creating a methodology to adapt modern analysis techniques from
                                 system building to message design. Initially, the HL7 Board of Directors chartered an independent task force to establish
                                 the broad outline of the approach. In January 1996, the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) agreed to adopt the main features
                                 of the approach and take over its management. Planning work continued in the Modeling and Methodology Work Group and the Implementation/Conformance
                                 Work Group. At the completion of V2.3, in the spring of 1997, the HL7 Work Groups all began to use the V3 process.

                        <p>The HL7 V3 standard development methodology is based on a set of principles providing a common philosophy for all HL7 V3 standard
                           developers.

                           <li><strong>Internationalization</strong>: V3 shall include mechanisms that support the need for local variants of HL7 messages to be used by HL7 Affiliates. It shall
                              be possible for affiliates to use the messages created by the worldwide HL7 organization. It shall also be possible for affiliates
                              to develop and use localized variants.
                              					
                           </li>
                           <li><strong>Legacy Systems Support</strong>: As with prior versions, V3 shall be designed using a technological approach that permits implementation in "legacy systems."
                              These are systems that have been implemented in technical environments that do not necessarily conform to or provide support
                              for recent or pending "open systems" standards, such as those published by ISO, Open Systems Foundation, Object Management
                              Group, etc. Similarly, HL7 will not require proprietary features of any operating system or software vendor. In practical
                              terms, this means that V3 shall be able to exchange messages formatted in strings of printable characters, as is the case
                              for all previous versions. This does not preclude HL7 from deciding to develop variants of its specification that make use
                              of the modern technologies provided that 1) System builders will not be required to buy software from a sole source in order
                              to implement V3, and 2) Messages generated in these formats have the same data content so that translation between the printable
                              character format and other formats is easy.

                              <p><strong>Loosely Coupled Systems</strong>: As with HL7 V2.x, V3 shall not be a standard for the functionality of the systems that exchange HL7 messages. However, where
                                 V3 includes a requirement to accept or send certain data or to send specific messages in response to trigger events or other
                                 messages, the application system may have to develop functionality to support those requirements.

                              <p>V3 messages may be sent using many modes and topologies. Messages may be sent in a manner that requires an immediate response,
                                 as unsolicited updates through a store and forward network, or in batches where the manner and timing of message transfer
                                 is not specified. V3 includes support for "one-to-many," store-and-forward distribution of messages by an external software
                                 agent.

                              <p><strong>V2.x Functional Compatibility</strong>: HL7 V3 goals cannot be achieved while maintaining full compatibility with previous versions. However, upon completion, V3
                                 shall cover the information content of the last version in the V2.x series including attributes and trigger events. This should
                                 not be construed to mean that all attributes and trigger events will be included in V3 in exactly the same form as within
                                 the V2.x series.
                              </p>
                              <p>A network that includes a mixture of systems that implement V2 and V3 will require message translation. Because the V2 standards
                                 have substantial optionality, the translations will use rules specific to the systems on that network. It is expected that
                                 interface engines and other translation software will be able to provide the translations between site-specific interpretations
                                 of V2.x and any implementation of V3.

                                 HL7 protocols in the V3 family through compatible enhancement.

                                    certain information fields because they were not a part of the older version of the message structure in use by a specific
                                    sender.

                                    								Where compatible enhancement is not possible, HL7 will require evolution in the protocol to happen gradually, so that
                                    users can introduce the change into their networks gradually.

                                    To the maximum degree possible, these restrictions should not impose limitations on the evolution of the overall reference

                              <p><strong>Determining Conformance</strong>: Application roles are the basis for conformance claims. An application role is an abstraction that expresses a portion of
                                 the messaging behavior of an information system. Application role names are different than the names generally used to describe
                                 healthcare information system products, since they describe messaging interfaces as opposed to application behavior. A typical
                                 healthcare information system will probably fill several or many application roles.
                              </p>
                              <p>In making a conformance claim, a system developer identifies the application roles to which it wishes to claim conformance.
                                 For these application roles, the V3 specification will state directly the trigger events the system shall recognize, messages
                                 that the system shall send in response to trigger events or other messages, and the data content of these messages. The specification
                                 also states the messages that a system conforming to the application role shall receive and process.
                              </p>
                              <p>All conformance claims shall be sufficiently specific to be used as contractual terms in system acquisitions and to be the
                                 basis for testing by an independent testing organization.
                              </p>
                              <p>User sites may contract with vendors to implement deviations from the HL7 conformance claims. Such arrangements are outside
                                 the scope of HL7. Such an arrangement will not be considered a failure of the application to conform to HL7.
                              </p>
                              <p>All sequences of messages in V3 shall be related to a trigger event. The trigger event shall be clearly identified in a common
                                 field in all messages.
                              </p>

                           <li><strong>Confidentiality of Patient Information</strong>: It is expected that healthcare application systems that implement V3 will be required to have significantly more functionality
                              to protect the confidentiality of patient information than has been common in the past. The new functions may include, but
                              are not limited to, limiting the right to view or transfer selected data to users with specific kinds of authorization and
                              auditing access to patient data. V3 will seek out and adopt industry security standards that support conveying the necessary
                              information from one healthcare application system to another, so that these systems may perform the confidentiality functions.
                              The Functional Work Groups, the Infrastructure and Messaging Work Group, and the Modeling and Methodology Work Group shall
                              consult with the Implementation/Conformance Work Group while developing the HL7 Data Model and V3 messages.

                           <li><strong>Authenticated Authorization for Services</strong>: It is expected that the healthcare application systems that implement V3 will be required to have significantly more functionality
                              to authenticate requests for services and reports of data than has been common in the past. The new functions may include,
                              but are not limited to, electronic signature and authentication of users based on technologies more advanced than passwords.
                              V3 will seek out and reference standards such as X.500 and RFC 1510 to support conveying the necessary information from one
                              healthcare application system to another, so that these systems may perform the authorization and authentication functions.
                              The functional Work Groups, the Infrastructure and Messaging Work Group and the Modeling and Methodology Work Group shall
                              consult with the Implementation/Conformance Work Group while developing the HL7 Data Model and V3 transactions.

                           <li><strong>Security, Privacy, Non-Repudiation and Integrity</strong>: It is expected that the technological platforms upon which V3 information systems developers implement applications that
                              use HL7 will be required to have significantly more capability to protect the confidentiality and integrity of patient information
                              than has been common in the past. The new functions may include, but are not limited to, public- and private-key encryption,
                              and correspondent system authentication and non-repudiation. The Control Group is monitoring these developments to ensure
                              that V3 can be implemented on technological platforms that support these new functions.

                           <li><strong>HL7 V3 adopts an Object Oriented (OO) approach using Unified Modeling Language (UML) principles.</strong> HL7 employs a completely new development approach with V3. HL7 V3 uses an OO approach that is model and repository-based.
                              This OO approach is supported with trained facilitators, formal education classes, and computerized tools. This approach leads
                              to increased detail, clarity and precision of the specification and finer granularity in the ultimate message. This helps
                              functional Work Groups meet the challenges of de novo interface design, and increases functional breadth and evolution of
                              assumptions. It helps new members become productive in fewer meetings. This is an enormous aid to providing institutional
                              memory and sharing work in progress across Work Groups and to the membership at large.

                           <li><strong>HL7 isn't just Level 7 any more!</strong> After years of implementing HL7 V2.x, HL7 standard developers realized it was virtually impossible to develop a comprehensive
                              standard without including other levels of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnect
                              (OSI) Model. Today, Work Groups exist for XML, Security &amp; Accountability, Modeling &amp; Methodology, Arden Syntax, CCOW and Vocabulary.
                              					
                           </li>
                           <li><strong>Reduced Optionality.</strong> Limiting optionality is a primary goal of HL7 V3. Within HL7 V2.x, almost every field is optional. This optionality is necessary
                              since optionality is defined by segment and segments are reused in multiple messages. Declaration of a data field as optional
                              within a segment allows that segment to be used in many different messages without any further definition. However, the wide
                              use of optionality, while helpful in gaining consensus and in writing a somewhat more compact specification, imposes significant
                              costs on interface implementers. In fact, optionality, as a "feature" of HL7 V 2.x, is associated with most of the issues
                              that V3 is trying to solve. Optionality makes it harder to precisely define the semantics of a specific message and makes
                              it virtually impossible to generate conformance claims for messaging.
                              					
                           </li>
                           <li><strong>Conformance to HL7 V3 will be testable.</strong> It is difficult to measure compliance of HL7 V2.x interfaces. Often vendors claim compliance to HL7 without providing any
                              supporting documentation of how they conform. Terms such as HL7-like or HL7-ish are used to describe HL7 interfaces. With
                              HL7 V3, conformance is specified in terms of application roles. Application roles are abstractions that express a portion
                              of the messaging behavior of an information system. A vendor of a healthcare application describes its conformance by asserting
                              that it completely supports all trigger events, messages and data elements associated with one or more application roles.
                              This level of specificity allows clearer pre-contractual understanding between vendors and buyers and will serve as a basis
                              for conformance testing.

                              <p>In order to ensure the highest quality of the work products produced during the course of V3 message development, the HL7
                                 Board of Directors has created the Architectural Review Board (ARB).
                              </p>
                              <p>The ARB works with the Work Groups and Modeling and Methodology Work Group to define quality measures for the HL7 work products,
                                 measure the work products again them, and ensure that adherence to the defined message development process is documented in
                                 a manner consistent with HL7 bylaws and procedures. The ARB does not have the right to amend work products or disallow their
                                 distribution. It does have the right to include with any work product a statement describing areas where it has determined
                                 that the work product has not met established measures of quality.
                              </p>
                              <p>As a general matter, the ARB is expected to include a statement of its findings in an HL7 general ballot package. However,
                                 in order to assist Work Groups, and to avoid delaying the balloting process, the ARB attempts to make any significant comments
                                 as early in the ballot cycle as possible.

                                    are the sets of allowable values for a coded field. For example, if a message contains a marital status field, then the vocabulary
                                    domain for that field would consist of the allowed values for that field, such as, single, married, divorced, and separated.
                                    Each coded attribute in the RIM will be associated with one and only one vocabulary domain.
