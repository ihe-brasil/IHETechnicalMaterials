                           <li>Health Status - the state of health
                              of a specified individual, group, or population. It may be measured
                              by obtaining proxies such as people's subjective assessments of their
                              health; by one or more indicators of mortality and morbidity in the
                              population, such as longevity or maternal and infant mortality; or
                              by using the incidence or prevalence of major diseases (communicable,
                              chronic, or nutritional). Conceptually, health status is the proper
                              outcome measure for the effectiveness of a specific population's
                              medical care system, although attempts to relate effects of available
                              medical care to variations in health status have proved difficult.

                        new data about a subject. Observations often involve measurement or other elaborate methods of investigation, but may also
                        be simply assertive statements.

                           Discussion: Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name
                           and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a &#8220;variable&#8221; (a named feature that
                           can assume a value); hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though
                           the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or
                           it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.
                           As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes
                           a description of what was actually observed (&#8220;results&#8221; or &#8220;answers&#8221;); and those &#8220;results&#8221; or &#8220;answers&#8221; are part of the observation
                           and not split off into other objects.

                           substance-administrations, and communicative interactions (e.g. teaching, advice, psychotherapy, represented simply as Acts
                           without special attributes). Procedure does not subsume those other activities nor is procedure subsumed by them. Notably
                           Procedure does not comprise all acts of whose intent is intervention or treatment. Whether the bodily alteration is appreciated
                           or intended as beneficial to the subject is likewise irrelevant, what counts is that the act is essentially an alteration
                           of the physical condition of the subject.
