                  </p>
                  <p>The aim of this release is to remove ambiguity regarding some of the "rules" expressed the Version 3, Release 1 material.</p>
                  <p>One serious issue that is still pending resolution is the allowance for CMET substitution by Affiliates.  (<a href="#CEClocaltypescmet3">CMETs
                        			(§
                        			5.4.2 )</a>)The language for this allowance has been updated based on input from the International Committee.
                  </p>
                  <p>A number of comments were received during balloting of this document regarding the synchronization of the concepts and terms
                     of this chapter with the same concepts and terms as discussed in the HDF.  This issue was discussed in both Conformance and
                     Modeling and Methodology work group meetings.  An agreement was reached that the normative 'source of truth' for any given
                     concept will reside in only one document.  All other documents will reference the normative language. Work continues to be
                     done by the Conformance work group to synchronise this document, the HDF and other relevant documents in this regard.

                  <p><strong>Data Type Specialization Requirements</strong></p>
                  <p>To ensure international interoperability the names of specializations which are not defined in the abstract data types specification
                     SHOULD NOT replace the base data type for a RIM attribute where this is communicated in an instance, but may be sent in addition
                     to this. The base data type is communicated in a way that is determined by the ITS, and for the XML ITS, this is achieved
                     using the XML attribute &#8220;xsi:type&#8221;. 
                     Referencing of user-defined data type specializations could be achieved by the addition of a new property to the abstract
                     type DataValue, alias ANY, in the next revision of the V3 Data Type Specification, currently scheduled for near term balloting.
                     A new property of specializationType could complement the existing property dataType so that both the base type and any user-defined
                     named specialization could be represented in an ITS appropriate way in any message.

                  <p><strong>Handling of Default (and Fixed) Values</strong></p>
                  <p>According to the current methodology, the structural attributes represent the interpretation of the classes in the model.
                     In the current XML ITS these structural attributes are represented as attributes within an element. As such, an attribute
                     of an element does have a higher priority than a name of an (XML) element (tag) itself. Therefore, one cannot trust the implied
                     semantics of element names as they are used in an XML document (instance). This prevents using XML schemas for their original
                     intent, i.e. validation of an XML document.
                     In order to avoid the encouragement to use schemas for validation, it is highly recommended that within an instance all values
                     SHALL be populated, whether default or fixed values have been assigned or not.
                     Secondly. current use of the XML ITS implicitly requires that sender and receiver SHALL have access to the appropriate schemas
                     to interpret the messages/documents correctly.

                        <p>The Version 3 standard provides a rich set of messages to support communications in a variety of clinical and other health
                           related domains. Moreover, HL7 Version 3 messages will be specific enough to permit strong conformance claims to be asserted
                           and verified.  Refer to <a href="#v3gconfclaims">Conformance Statements

                              			4 )</a> for more details. Nevertheless, any standard faces two challenges.  First, it can always be made more specific in order to
                           provide a more precise solution to a particular requirement.  Second, it will not contain all of the data needed in every
                           environment, particularly when international requirements are considered.  These challenges lead to a pair of complementary
                           requirements:  the ability to constrain the standard in more detail, and the ability to extend the standard in a controlled
                           fashion.

                        <p>Intertwined with the notions of constraining and extending the standard are two critical capabilities  the ability to establish
                           a testable statement of conformance to the standard, and the ability to create a "profile" of the standard that formally defines
                           how the standard will be implemented in a particular setting.
                        </p>
                        <p>A <strong>profile</strong> is a set of information used to document system requirements or capabilities from an information exchange perspective.  The
                           documentation is expressed in terms of constraints, extensions, or other alterations to a referenced standard or another profile.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>Profiles of the HL7 Version 3 standard must be derived, directly or indirectly, from a Version 3 specification, as balloted
                           either by HL7 or by one of its affiliates.

                        <p>A <strong>binding realm</strong> manages the bindings/substitutions of Valuesets and CMETs (and templates and data type specializations if and when substitution
                           rules for these are agreed) to reflect local rules. The realm is communicated by InfrastructureRoot.realmCode and determines
                           conformance rules for vocabulary, data type, etc. Each binding realm has a <strong>binding realm owner</strong>: this organization must be an Affiliate. In some exceptional cases the binding realm owner may be a group of Affiliates (if
                           they have an agreement to share ownership), e.g. for binding realms like "Dutch-German cross-border hospitalisation", "European-Indian
                           dental tourism" or "US-Canadian Pharmacy".

                              <p>An annotation profile is used to further explain the base document to educate prospective users and/or implementers. An annotation
                                 profile will usually enhance the descriptions of the elements of the base specification in order to relate them to a particular
                                 context.

                              <p>A constraint profile reduces the optionality and cardinality of the base specification (i.e., the HL7 V3 standard)  in order
                                 to make the specification more exact and to approach "plug-and-play" interoperability.

                              <p>An implementable profile eliminates all optionality of the base specification (i.e., the HL7 V3 standard) in order to make
                                 the specification exact and to approach "plug-and-play" interoperability.  Optionality for a profile is eliminated when the
                                 conformance indicator for every attribute and association is something other than Unspecified (namely Required or Not Permitted)
                                 and every vocabulary domain is bound to a value-set. (see section 2.1.2 for conformance indicator and 2.5 for vocabulary domain)

                              <p>A localization profile is usually designed to meet the same objectives as a constraint profile, except that the demands of
                                 the intended implementation context mandate additional elements, as represented in the extensions.  Normally, extensions will
                                 represent the minimum changes to the base specification (i.e., the HL7 V3 standard) needed to meet those requirements.  Furthermore
                                 Data Type Specializations can also be used to adapt a profile to local needs.

                              <p>By definition, a conflicting profile represents an implementation that cannot reliably interoperate with other implementations
                                 of the same base standard or base profile.  The reason for creating such a profile is to document the incompatibilities.

                        <p>This document specifies the rules and principles that govern the definition of profiles, but does not state how to represent
                           these profiles.  A formal representation of profiles is required in order to allow the creation of tooling to assist in development,
                           documentation, comparison, and testing.  Such representation is outside the scope of this standard.

It then establishes the rules for refining these base standards to arrive at the information structures

                        <p>The strategy for development of Version 3 messages and related information structures, as discussed in the <b><a class="elink" href="../../help/v3guide/v3guide.htm#">Version 3 Guide</a></b>, is based upon the consistent application of constraints to a pair of base specifications  the <b><a class="elink" href="../../infrastructure/rim/rim.htm#">HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM)</a></b> and the <b><a class="elink" href="../../infrastructure/vocabulary/vocabulary.htm#">HL7 Vocabulary Domains</a></b>  and upon the extension of those specifications to create representations constrained to address a specific health care
                           requirement.  The processes described are precisely the processes that the HL7 Technical Committees followed in developing
                           Version 3 standards.  Thus, this section also serves as a reference work for the core standard.
                        </p>
                        <p>Just as the standard is developed using a series of constraints and targeted extensions, the design of applications to implement
                           these messages, the definition of conformance claims, and the definition of localization specifications, will all require
                           further constraint and extension of the base standard.

                           the specification for an <b><a class="elink" href="../../help/v3guide/v3guide.htm#v3ghmd">Hierarchical Message Descriptions (HMD) and its resulting Message Types</a></b>.  In reality, as discussed in the Version 3 Guide, some of the Message Types derived from a single HMD may represent a further
                           constraint on the common, or base, Message Type for that HMD.  Although this is not shown in the diagram above, this constraint
                           also follows the rules outlined in this section.

                        <p>The fundamental rules of constraint, cloning and extension remain the same at each stage. This is true even though: the documentation
                           of the constraints may vary stage to stage; the results may be documented in different forms; and the constraint process may
                           be coupled with other processes, such as those for generating an HMD, and its resulting Message Type, from an R-MIM.  Refer
                           to section 1.1 of the HDF which replaces section 10.3.3 of the  <a href="http://www.hl7.org/library/mdf99/mdf99.pdf" target="_blank">Message Development Framework (MDF)</a> v3.3 document, published December 1999.

                  <p>Constraints are the central feature of the refinement process, as they reduce the generality of the specification and focus
                     it on a particular requirement. The constraints that may be asserted against a model element , e.g., attribute or association,
                     fall into six broad categories:
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Appearance constraints</strong> determine whether a particular element must appear in models or messages derived from the base model, and/or whether the
                     element is precluded from appearing therein.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Cardinality constraints</strong> define the number of repetitions that may occur for a given element.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Type constraints</strong> limit the structure or "type" of the element in question.  These are constraints placed upon the data types for attributes
                     and upon the use of <b><a class="elink" href="../../help/v3guide/v3guide.htm#v3gcmet">Common Message Element Types (CMET)</a></b>  for associations. 
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Vocabulary constraints</strong> limit the set of concepts that can be taken as valid values in an instance of a coded attribute or data type.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Other value constraints</strong> provide for the declaration of constraints stated as text and, optionally, as testable expressions to establish "business
                     rules", and for the assertion of default or fixed values.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Annotations</strong> provide further explanations to educate prospective users and/or implementers. These are usually used to enhance the descriptions
                     of the elements of the base specification in order to relate them to a particular Context.

                           					Cardinality constraints apply only to attributes and associations. Every attribute or association element in a model
                           has an explicit or implicit cardinality. The cardinality expresses the number of times an attribute or association may appear
                           in a derived model or message. Since associations in HL7 models are directional, the cardinality constraint of an association
                           is equal to its destination multiplicity, i.e. the minimum and maximum number of times instances of the target class may be
                           referenced.

                           					Cardinality constraints are constraints on the repetitions of a model element. Attributes may be constrained by more
                           specific minimum and maximum cardinality values and associations may be constrained by more specific source and destination
                           multiplicities. The rules for applying such constraints are articulated in the following section.

                              <p>The maximum cardinality is expressed either as a positive integer (greater than zero and greater than or equal to the minimum
                                 cardinality) or as unlimited using an asterisk ("*").  If the maximum cardinality is greater than one, the type for the associated

                                 in the source model's range.  Two rules further constrain a cardinality change: (a) the minimum cardinality of the resulting
                                 range must be less than or equal to the maximum cardinality; and (b) the maximum cardinality must be greater than or equal

                                 In HL7 designs this constraint is applied primarily to structural attributes  those attributes whose coded values are needed
                                 to fully interpret the classes that they classify.  According to the HDF, if an attribute or association is described as mandatory
                                 in a model, then in all message instances that are derived from this model, the element must be present and non-null.  In

                           					Type constraints apply to attributes and associations. Each of these model elements has a type explicitly or implicitly
                           derived from information in the model specification. The type of a class or class clone can be determined either from the
                           classCode or typeCode attribute of the class.. The type of an attribute is the data type declared for that attribute in the
                           model. Since associations in HL7 models are directional, the type of an association is defined to be the type of its target
                           element. If the target element is a Choice of classes, then the type of the association is Choice.

                           					Type constraints are constraints on the type of a model element. Classes may be constrained by more specific classes
                           or class clones, attributes may be constrained by more specific data types, and associations may be constrained by more specific
                           target classes. If the target class of an association is a <b><a class="elink" href="../../help/v3guide/v3guide.htm#v3gcmet">Common Message Element Types (CMETs)</a></b>, then the association can only be constrained to another defined CMET that is a constrained version of the current CMET.
                           The following sections address allowed data type or CMET hierarchies that can be used for determining more specific type constraints.

                              <p>When an information model is converted to a serialized  information structure such as a message, each association in the information
                                 model will be assigned a type based upon the class or clone to which the association connects.  This is analogous to the assignment
                                 of data types to attributes of the information model.  
                              </p>
                              <p>Although the type for an association may be defined by a type within an R-MIM, it is also possible to constrain the association
                                 by assigning it a formally-defined type.  These formally-defined types are the Common Message Element Types or CMETs. Refer

                              <p>Each CMET is based on a specific RIM class and a particular set of codes for the structural attributes (eg. classCode, moodCode,
                                 typeCode and/or determinerCode) that characterize the class. The CMETs themselves are defined using a restriction hierarchy
                                 allowing CMETs to be constrained as part of the overall model refinement process.

                                    <p><strong>CMET substitution</strong><br />When a model is being refined, a CMET may be substituted for a class or a class clone, provided that (a) the CMET is based
                                       on either the same class as the class being substituted or on a sub-type of that class, and (b) the values for the structural
                                       codes for the CMET fall within the vocabulary domains specified for those attributes in the source model, and (c) that the
                                       body of the CMET that is substituted uses the constraint and extension rules described by this document for the model being
                                       refined.  Realms are allowed to define CMETs that extend the base CMET according to standard realm extension permissions.
                                       When a realm formally adopts by ballot a localized version of an international CMET, all artifacts (messages, documents, etc.)
                                       that declare conformance in that realm SHALL use that localized version.

                                    <p><strong>CMET constraint hierarchy</strong><br />When a model or Message Type is constrained, the CMETs within that model may be further constrained along the defined restriction
                                       hierarchy for CMETs.  The hierarchy is based on a general to specific refinement.  The hierarchy begins with the general Universal
                                       CMET and ends with the Identified CMET.

                                             									A <strong>Detailed</strong> CMET provides an intermediate level of information. Frequently this means that it provides sufficient information to recognize
                                             and manage a new instance of an item by loosely coupled systems.  Thus "Detailed" may be constrained to "Identified".    There
                                             is no implied hierarchy between two different Detailed CMETs constrained from the same Universal CMET.  Note that the use
                                             of "Detailed" here is descriptive rather than prescriptive &#8211; it simply includes other CMET types that have been defined as
                                             restrictions on the "Universal" type which also may also be further constrained, i.e. the constraint hierarchy is not limited
                                             to the levels described here

                              <p>An HL7 v3 static model may contain a Choice element in the model. The Choice element is treated as if it were a class itself.
                                 The Choice element contains a finite number of other classes. Choices do not contain attributes; however both the Choice and

                        <p>Vocabulary constraints limit the values that coded attributes or data type properties may take on. In the following paragraphs
                           the term attribute means either a class attribute or a data type property. If an attribute is derived from data type CD, or
                           if the declared data type can be constrained to CD, then it is a potential coded attribute and is subject to vocabulary constraints.
                           Vocabulary constraints depend upon vocabulary terminology defined by the Vocabulary Technical Committee, and include terms
                           such as vocabulary domain, code system and value set. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In general, a potential coded attribute will be bound to a vocabulary domain at the time of first definition.  A vocabulary
                           domain is like a semantic type that abstractly identifies the type of concepts that will be included in the domain. It does
                           not itself define specific coded concepts.  At some point in the refinement process, an attribute may be bound to a sub-domain
                           of a vocabulary domain or to a value set. A value set is a collection of specific codes from one or more code systems, where
                           the codes within a value set each have a distinct meaning defined by the code system. If an attribute is bound to a value-set,
                           then further constraints on an attribute by sub-domains is not useful.
                        </p>
                        <p>An attribute has a <strong> coding strength </strong> that determines whether or not a user of the HL7 v3 standard may communicate a coded value that is not of the defined domain
                           or from the defined value set. The HL7 RIM and data type documents define coding strengths of Coded with Exceptions (CWE)
                           and Coded, No Exceptions (CNE). CWE allows the end user to send a term from an arbitrary coding system in place of a term
                           from the specified value set in the circumstance when the concept being encoded is not represented in the specified value
                           set, whereas CNE requires that the primary code in a message instance be from the specified value set. Committees that are
                           contemplating tightening the coding strength from CWE to CNE SHOULD consider whether the value set in question is sufficiently
                           stable and comprehensive that it can support such constraint.  Each coded attribute will carry one of these two coding strengths.
                           By default, data type properties are of coding strength CNE.  Attributes constraints expressed in universal specifications
                           should be constrained only to vocabulary domains and not bound to value sets.  The sole exception to this principle is the
                           constraint "structural attributes".
                        </p>
                        <p>Coded attributes in the RIM are identified with a flag that indicates whether or not they are <strong>realm-specializable</strong>. This property of an attribute remains fixed throughout the refinement process. The term realm used in this context means
                           <strong> binding realm</strong> as defined in the HL7 glossary. A binding realm is under the direct control of HL7 or an HL7 affiliate. All structural coded
                           attributes in the RIM and all data type coded properties are by definition <strong>not realm-specializable</strong>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Vocabulary domains that are bound to a coded attribute inherit the realm-specializable property of that attribute. Some vocabulary
                           domains are classified as <strong>universal</strong>, which means that a single universal value set is bound to the domain at domain definition. Every attribute that is not realm-specializable
                           will eventually be bound to a universal vocabulary domain and a single universal value set at some point in the technical
                           committee refinement process. Additional or alternative value set bindings for such attributes are not permitted. All vocabulary
                           domains associated with RIM structural attributes and data type properties are universal. Realm-specializable vocabulary domains
                           may be bound to a specific value set in a binding realm. If a realm-specializable vocabulary domain is bound to a value set,
                           then any attribute bound to that vocabulary domain will also be bound to that specific value set for any model defined within
                           that binding realm. Any attribute bound to a value set may still be further constrained and bound to a subset of that value
                           set in subsequent refinements or in profiles or templates.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the refinement process, a child model may be defined with certain vocabulary constraints enforced on a parent model.
                           Such vocabulary constraints may be applied to a vocabulary domain, a value-set, or a coding strength, with some limitations.

                              <p>A default value may be declared for an attribute of an HL7 class. The default is a single value that the receiver shall use
                                 when it receives a message instance that does not contain the attribute. If the default is unspecified, the 'default default'
                                 is the simple form of null (NI). The meaning of a default value is that in the absence of any explicit value for an attribute
                                 in a message instance, the default value is assumed. A Default value has no impact on what explicit values may be assigned
                                 to the attribute in a message instance.

                                 attribute.  Once a default is assigned to an attribute, a different default cannot be assigned for the same attribute in a
                                 derived model.  For example, if a default is assigned in a D-MIM, a different default shall not be assigned in a derived D-MIM,
                                 R-MIM or Message Type.

                                 profile. For example, a declaration of Act.classCode DEFAULT OBS means that any Act class code can be inserted into a message
                                 instance, including one not below OBS in the class code hierarchy, but that the absence of the attribute message element implies
                                 that the assumed value is OBS.

                                 for a Fixed attribute. The meaning of Fixed is that the attribute value, once set in a model refinement remains unchanged
                                 in any subordinate refined models.  Unlike a default value, there are no assumptions about default meaning when the attribute
                                 is missing.

                                 the wire. As a corollary, data type CS may not be used for any attribute or property where it is not already specified in
                                 the RIM or ADT specification because of its characteristic of fixing the codeset.

                              <p><strong>Invoking the constraint</strong><br /> In most situations there will be no difference between a textual constraint (<a href="#CECtext3">Explicit Constraint Statements
                                    			(§
                                    			2.6.3 )</a>) that constrains an attribute to a single value and a Fixed declaration for that attribute that specifies a single fixed
                                 value. In either case, the value is always the same and it cannot be changed to a different value in the refinement process.
                                 However, when Fixed is applied to an attribute along with a constraint that allows multiple values, e.g. Act.classCode FIXED
                                 &lt;= Act, the meaning is that the creator of a refinement may choose any value from this set that satisfies the constraint,
                                 but the value is then fixed both for the refined model and any subsequent refinement.

                           when revising Definition annotations.  Changing a definition could represent a constraint, extension or even a conflict with
                           the original content depending on whether the new definition encompasses concepts that are narrower than, broader than or
                           inconsistent with the original definition.  A definition in a constraint profile should always be a narrower than the definition
                           it constrains.

                  <p>Section 1 and Section 2 of this Chapter have discussed the rules whereby information models (RIM, D-MIM and R-MIM) and message
                     designs in HMDs may be successively constrained to define more specific designs.  This process of refinement from RIM to D-MIM
                     to R-MIM to HMD to Message Type is the primary development process followed by the HL7 Technical Committees in defining the
                     artifacts that are balloted as HL7 Version 3 specifications. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Once an HL7 specification has been balloted and formally published, it may be further constrained for a variety of purposes,
                     including:
                  </p>
                  <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                     <li>realm-specific localizations by an HL7 Affiliate</li>
                     <li>for use in communities of interest (for example, a set of collaborating health care institutions, a community of vendors or
                        an external standards organization)
                     </li>
                     <li>for a specific project</li>
                     <li>to define a vendor's capability or a consumer's requirements</li>
                     <li>to define content templates to be used when communicating HL7 messages </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> The constraints derived from the purposes listed above, and for all other purposes are documented using a constraint profile.</p>
                  <p>A constraint profile is an expression of local constraints applied to an HL7 standard RMIM, HMD, or Message Type or to another
                     constraint profile.  Every instance message that is valid for the Message Type defined by the profile must also be valid for
                     the base Message Type.
                  </p>
                  <p>These profile types are described below.  Each uses the constraint mechanisms described previously, but with varying limitations
                     on which constraints they may invoke.
                  </p>
                  <p>The constraint profile design process starts with the lowest-level R-MIM or the HMD that defines the profile's base Message
                     Type.  The process then uses the constraint refinement rules detailed previously to define a new Message Type.
                  </p>
                  <p>A constraint profile is to be documented as a Message Type derived from an HMD. A simple constraint profile may be derived
                     from the same HMD from which the base Message Type is derived. More complex constraint profiles will be based on a new R-MIM.
                     In that case, the profile will be documented as a new Message Type derived from a new HMD which, in turn, is derived from
                     the refined R-MIM.

                        <p>The previous discussion of <a href="#CECcloning3">Cloning classes
                              			(§
                              			2.2.3 )</a> introduced the notion of creating additional constrained copies (clones) of the classes that are present in the RIM, a D-MIM
                           or an R-MIM.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cloning may occur wherever there is an association with maximum cardinality greater than one.  This includes both recursive
                           associations, such as an act relationship "component" association and other repeats such as SET&lt;Participation&gt;.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Instance validation</strong><br />To be a conformant message instance, a message instance based on the refinement must be valid according to the original (base)
                           specification from which the refinement was derived, even if the use of cloning requires that a translation or transformation
                           is necessary.  In order for an application to be conformant, it must only send conformant message instances.
                        </p>
                        <p>Any message instance that can be validated against a more constrained static model should still validate against the base
                           model.  In an XML ITS, ensuring that the instance can be validated against the base model involves transforming the XML element
                           tag names to be those of the parent model  the semantics do not change, just the labels. 
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Documentation</strong><br />The refined R-MIM should be documented with a new R-MIM diagram that explicitly displays the new clones derived from the R-MIM
                           clones of the base diagram, and a new HMD from which one or more  new, restrictive, Message Types can be derived.

                        <p>Declaring the implementation of an application role(s) is the basis for claiming conformance to the HL7 V3 standard.  Despite
                           the fact that the application roles are documented in the normative domain specifications, the HL7 Technical Steering Committee
                           has declared that applications roles shall be informative, not normative, in this release of Version 3. The reason for this
                           declaration is that HL7 wishes to see a number of Version 3 implementations before it specifies the content and granularity
                           of application roles.  Because application roles are informative in this release, the focus of declaring conformance rests
                           with the declaration of the interaction(s) supported by an implementation.  Optionally application roles may be declared.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>The parties that need to communicate about conformance are the sponsors and users. The sponsor of an information system is
                           the vendor, in-house developer, or provider of public domain software.  The user of a health care information system is the
                           organization that buys, leases or employs an information system for which the software was developed.  
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to messaging, the specifications created by the HL7 Technical Committees are informatively bundled by application
                           roles.  These application roles (i.e., the set of interactions) can be the basis for users stating requirements and sponsors
                           declaring implementation capabilities.    The common mechanism both parties may use is the profile.  Users can create a profile
                           to articulate their proposed system requirements.  Sponsors can create a profile to describe its systems implementation of
                           application roles (i.e., the set of interactions).  With both parties using the same profile mechanism, the profile can become
                           the common language used between parties to articulate requirements, articulate the capabilities of an implementation, and
                           measure conformance.  The profile used by sponsors to describe their capabilities for conformance purposes is called a <strong>conformance profile</strong>.  The conformance profile, used in conjunction with the appropriate HL7 application role specifications, may be used as conformance
                           criteria.
                        </p>
                        <p>The definition of formal conformance specification rules and the requirement for using a formal V3 conformance registry process
                           will appear in the same release declaring application roles normative. 
                        </p>
                        <p>When certification methods are developed for V3, conformance tests will be used to determine whether a sponsors system has
                           correctly implemented the specification. These will not be available until application roles are declared normative.

                           a conformance claim.   The conformance profile may be either a constraint profile or an implementable profile.  A declarative
                           statement asserting a conformance claim may be made against a third-party developed profile (e.g., vendor, provider, Affiliate),
                           thus linking the conformance profile to the third-partys profile.  If an explicit declarative conformance claim does not
                           exist in the conformance statement, then the sponsor is making an implicit conformance claim against the HL7 V3 specification

                           the document.   In future releases, a formal structure for a conformance statement and a conformance profile will be defined.
                           The intent is that this formal structure will be machine processable.

                                 to the other constituent groups because they have formal, consensus-based approval processes within their membership.  In

                              <p>Extensions with general utility should be proposed to HL7, or an HL7 Affiliate, for inclusion in the next version of the standard.
                                 For example, if during the development of a laboratory interface it was determined that some tests require information that
                                 is not contained within the defined messages (such as the last menstrual period relative to a hormone assay), then it would
                                 be reasonable to develop an extension to support this requirement.  As a generally useful concept, this extension should be
                                 proposed for consideration.  Even if the proposal is not accepted, consideration of the concept(s) may be a path for continued
                                 evolution of the standard.

                              <p>Implementation-specific extensions that are not relevant to the general healthcare community might not benefit the standard
                                 as a proposal.  For example, extensions may be necessary if an interface message needed to include display-positioning terms
                                 so that the receiving application can emulate a prior display layout.  Such display-positioning terms may not be relevant
                                 beyond the specific implementation. <strong> Implementation-specific extensions shall not be subject to submittal to an HL7 Committee for possible standardization.</strong></p>
                              <p>Informal extensions can be employed to address implementation-specific requirements as long as such extensions can be isolated
                                 within the message. This isolation provides a means for a receiving system to ignore all non-standard content. "Isolation"
                                 of informal extensions is accomplished on an Implementation Technology Specific (ITS) basis and is described in the relevant
                                 ITS.

                                             relative to local extensions must be defined on a site-specific basis.

                                    <p>When a committee accepts a proposal to introduce an informal extension into the standard, that extension is subject to the
                                       ballot and publication process before it is included in the standard.  Implementers may choose to incorporate these extensions
                                       into their interface development prior to publication within the standard.  This approach should be taken with caution as
                                       these extensions may undergo some changes during the ballot resolution process.  If the resulting standard meets the local
                                       requirements of the implementer, the implementer shall use the standard in lieu of the informal extension.  However if the
                                       standard does not meet the local requirements of the implementer, the implementer may continue to use the informal extension.

                                       or the proposed informal extension, the submitter may choose to re-define the general utility informal extension as an implementation-specific

                                       to non-standard requirements.  While using non-conformant extensions is not part of the standard, they may provide a consistent

                              <p><strong>Registration</strong><br />Registration is intended to assure that all of the HL7 constituents are aware of localizations that are being developed, and
                                 have access to the definitions thereof.  In this release, HL7 does not support a formal registration process.  Future releases
                                 of HL7 V3 will require, and HL7 will support, a formal registration process.  The registration process shall:

                              <ul style="margin-left:20px;">

                                 <li>result in the automatic notification of the registration</li>
                                 <li>require the provision of data to support subsequent harmonization</li>
                                 <li>include an obligation to consult on the most closely relevant listserver prior to proceeding</li>
                                 <li>be subject to review by the relevant Technical Committee for potential subsequent submission in an HL7 ballot (the status
                                    of a registration entry shall accordingly be marked as pending decision, approved or rejected).

                              <p><strong>Affiliate Ballot</strong><br />Each HL7 Affiliate maintains a consensus voting procedure for approval of HL7 specifications. These processes are specified
                                 by the Affiliates in their own bylaws (or equivalent documents).  Several of the localization items listed below are subject
                                 to an affiliate consensus ballot.

                              <p><strong>Harmonization</strong><br />Harmonization is a set of processes adopted by the Methodology &amp; Modeling Technical Committee and the Vocabulary Technical
                                 Committee to provide for the review and adoption of the HL7 Vocabulary Domains and changes to the HL7 Reference Information
                                 Model.

                              <p><strong>Realm</strong><br />Some localization practices permitted for affiliates may negatively affect (break) interoperability between realms and other
                                 Affiliates.  For example, specifying different default values for different realms may cause issues when communicating between
                                 realms.

                                 						One message can contain content from multiple realms.  For example, HL7 Canada might have realms for different regions
                                 in Canada.  A message containing Electronic Health Record (EHR) extracts from different regions could well make use of the
                                 different realms.

                                 						A sending application communicates, as part of a conformance statement, what realms they support for each interaction.
                                 If they receive something from a realm they don't support, they can reject it.

                              <p>HL7 Version 3 data type specializations are localized constraints that restrict data types, resulting in data types which
                                 are applicable to a specific region, project or other localization. This section documents the requirements for these constraints,
                                 and discusses methods to assert their use in models and instances.

                                    <p>Data type Specializations are localized constraints that can be used to restrict HL7 data type definitions in specific HL7
                                       Contexts. For example, AD.UK.BSI7766 might be a constrained subset (specialization) of the HL7 address data type (AD) that
                                       applies the rules defined in BSI standard 7766 to localize addresses that are to be used within the UK. Such a specialization
                                       may be defined within a package balloted by the HL7UK affiliate, and referenced by specifications approved by that affiliate,
                                       and message profiles produced for use in the UK.

                                    <p>Data type Specializations may be flagged as &#8216;abstract&#8217; and where this is the case they cannot be used in message instances.
                                       Abstract data type specializations refine an HL7 data type for use within a specific application and/or context. Abstract
                                       data type specializations are always based on one normative HL7 data type. An abstract data type specialization can be used
                                       to group a set of choices based on different data types, providing that all of the choices are valid refinements of the grouping
                                       specialization (The grouping specialization can be a refinement of the general purpose HL7 ANY data type that identifies the
                                       full set of HL7 data types).  While abstract data type specializations may not be referenced in the instances, they may be
                                       included in model specifications to constraint the type of a RIM attribute.

                                    <p>A concrete data type specialization identifies a model that can be used to validate instance of a localized model. A concrete
                                       data type is a refinement of a single HL7 data type. A concrete data type may be, but need not be, a refinement of an abstract
                                       data type specialization. Where a concrete data type specialization is a refinement of an abstract data type specialization
                                       it identifies which member of the set of choices permitted by the abstract data type has been/should be used to validate the
                                       component.

                                             SHOULD NOT replace the  base data type for a RIM attribute where this is communicated in an instance, but may be sent in addition
                                             to this. The base data type is communicated in a way that is determined by the ITS, and for the XML ITS, this is achieved
                                             using the XML attribute &#8220;xsi:type&#8221;.

                                             A new property of specializationType (as of June 2007 flavorId) could complement the existing property dataType so that both
                                             the base type and any user-defined named specialization could be represented in an ITS appropriate way in any message.

                                             a specialization IVLcomplete may be defined that requires a high and low component, and the type IVLcomplete&lt;TS&gt; be used in
