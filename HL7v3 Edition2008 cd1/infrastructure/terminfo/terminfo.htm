                           pattern. The intent is to guide implementers in the construction of instances based on models derived from that pattern. These
                           include models covering the representation of clinical information from the perspective of various HL7 domains including Structured

                        <p>The guidance in this document should also be applied to the use of SNOMED CT in other HL7 V3 models that share features with
                           the Clinical Statement model, unless domain specific requirements prevent this.

                        <p>Section 2 (normative) provides detailed guidance on dealing with specific overlaps between RIM and SNOMED CT semantics. It
                           contains normative recommendations for use of SNOMED CT in relevant attributes of various RIM classes including Acts, ActRelationships
                           and Participations. It also contains a subsection providing recommendations on Context conduction.  Each subsection in consists

                        <p>Section 3 (informative) provides a set of examples and patterns for representing common clinical statements. The approaches
                           taken are consistent with the normative statements in Sections 2 and 5, as well as work being done within HL7 domain committees.
                        </p>
                        <p>Section 4 (informative) describes normal forms, including their use with SNOMED CT. It also discusses considerations for transformations
                           between various common representations and SNOMED CT or HL7 RIM based normal forms.

                        <p>Section 5 (normative) contains a number of constraints on SNOMED CT Concepts applicable to relevant attributes in each of
                           the major classes in the Clinical Statement pattern. These normative constraints are presented as a series of tables in section
                           5.3. This section also summarises the benefits and weaknesses of the constraints offered (see also Appendix E).

                              <p>One of the primary goals of HL7 Version 3 is to deliver standards that enable semantic interoperability. Semantic interoperability
                                 is a step beyond the exchange of information between different applications that was demonstrated by earlier versions of HL7.
                                 The additional requirement is that a receiving application should be able to retrieve and process communicated information,
                                 in the same way that it is able to retrieve and process information that originated within that application. To meet this
                                 requirement the meaning of the information communicated must be represented in an agreed, consistent and adequately expressive
                                 form.
                              </p>
                              <p>Clinical information is information that is entered and used primarily for clinical purposes. The clinical purposes for which
                                 information may be used include care of the individual patient and support to population care. In both cases there are requirements
                                 for selective retrieval of information either from within a single patient record or from the set of records pertaining to
                                 the population being studied. Meeting these requirements depends on consistent interpretation of the meaning of stored and
                                 communicated information. This requires an understanding of the varied and potentially complex ways in which similar information
                                 may be represented. This complexity is apparent both in the range of clinical concepts that need to be expressed and the relationships
                                 between instances of these concepts.
                              </p>
                              <p>Delivering semantic interoperability in this field presents a challenge for traditional methods of data processing and exchange.
                                 Addressing this challenge requires an agreed way to represent reusable clinical concepts and a way to express instances of
                                 those concepts within a standard clinical record, document or other communication.

                                 essential coded attributes but also supports use of external terminologies to express more detailed information.
                                 SNOMED CT is one of the external terminologies that may be used in HL7 communications.

                              <p>The RIM is an abstract model and leaves many degrees of freedom with regard to representing a specific item of clinical information.
                                 The HL7 Clinical Statement project is developing and maintaining a more refined model for representing discrete instances
                                 of clinical information and the context within which they are recorded.
                              </p>
                              <p>The HL7 Clinical Statement pattern is a refinement of the RIM, which provides a consistent structural approach to representation
                                 of clinical information across a range of different domains. However, neither the RIM nor the Clinical Statement pattern place
                                 any limits on the level of clinical detail that may be expressed in a structured form. At the least structured extreme, an
                                 HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) document may express an entire encounter as text with presentational markup, without
                                 any coded clinical information. An intermediate level of structure might be applied when communicating a clinical summary
                                 with each diagnosis and operative procedure represented as a separate coded statement.  Requirements for more comprehensive
                                 communication of electronic health records can be met by using the Clinical Statement pattern to fully structure and encode
                                 each individual finding and/or each step in a procedure.
                              </p>
                              <p>The Clinical Statement pattern is the common foundation for the CDA Entries in HL7 Clinical Document Architecture release
                                 2 and for the clinical information content of HL7 Care Provision messages. Details of the Clinical Statement pattern can be
                                 found in the Common Domains section of the HL7 Version 3 Publication (see <a href="../../domains/uvcs/uvcs.htm#spec-scope">clinical statements</a>).

                                 Even within the constraints of the Clinical Statement pattern, similar clinical information can be represented in different
                                 ways. One key variable is the nature of the code system chosen to represent the primary semantics of each statement. The other
                                 key variable is the way in which overlaps and gaps between the expressiveness of the information model (clinical statement)
                                 and the chosen terminology are dealt with.

                                 is one of the external terminologies that can and will be used in HL7 Version 3 communications. SNOMED CT has various features
                                 that add flexibility to the range and detail of meanings that can be represented. These features summarized below are documented

                                                post-coordination rules allow refinement of the "finding site" and "associated morphology" attributes in the definition of

                                             <li>Therefore the required information can be recorded by refining the concept "fracture of femur" with the site "neck of femur"

                                       that may also be represented by an information model such as the HL7 RIM. For example:

                                          <li>a single SNOMED CT coded expression can represent a meaning that the HL7 RIM could also represent using a combination of several
                                             coded attributes or related classes;
                                          </li>

                                    <p>There is a requirement for clear rules and guidance on these overlaps to minimize the risk that alternative representational

                              <p>The guide identifies options for use of SNOMED CT concepts, in both pre and post-coordinated forms in various attributes of
                                 HL7 RIM classes. The primary focus is on the RIM class clones used in the HL7 Clinical Statement pattern. However, the general
                                 principles of the advice are also applicable to many RIM class clones used in constrained information models that form part
                                 of other HL7 specifications and standards.

                              <p>In some situations, the features of HL7 Version 3 and SNOMED CT dictate a single way to utilize these two models together.
                                 Where this is true, the guide contains a single recommended approach which is normative, based on referenced pre-existing
                                 standards.

                        <p>The intent of this section is to describe the requirements and criteria used to weigh various instance representations in
                           order to arrive at the recommendations in this specification.
                        </p>
                        <p>As discussed above, there are situations where there are several possible ways to combine HL7 and SNOMED CT to resolve a gap
                           or overlap. In these cases, the advantages and disadvantages of each option are evaluated using the criteria stated here.
                           The guide recommends against approaches that have a disproportionate balance of disadvantages and are unlikely to deliver
                           semantic interoperability. In some cases, the guide contains advice on several alternative approaches and the recommended
                           approach may be based on prior implementation in accordance with criterion 4 below.
                        </p>
                        <p>The following criteria have been identified to address these requirements:</p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>Understandable, Reproducible, Useful: Normative statements and recommendations in this guide:
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Must be widely understandable by implementers who are familiar with the use of SNOMED CT and HL7 V3.</li>
                                 <li>Must be able to be applied consistently.</li>
                                 <li>Must cover common scenarios, but need not cover all conceivable cases of SNOMED/HL7 overlap. </li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                           <li>Transformable into a common "Model of Meaning": Normative statements and recommendations in this guide should result in instance
                              representations that can be converted, by following a set of computationally tractable rules, into a single normal form (known
                              as the "Model of Meaning").<a name="fn-src3"></a><a href="#fn3"><sup style="font-size: smaller">3</sup></a><ul>
                                 <li>Where this implementation guide supports multiple representations of the same meaning, they are all transformable to one another
                                    and/or into a single Model of Meaning.
                                 </li>
                                 <li>Representations that can be reused consistently in many contexts (problem list, family history, chief complaint, medical history,
                                    documentation of findings, final diagnosis, etc.) are preferred to representations that are specific to a particular context.
                                 </li>
                                 <li>Representation of data, precisely in the form in which it was captured in the application of origin (also referred to as the
                                    "Model of Use"), is not recommended unless the representation is transformable into a common Model of Meaning. 
                                 </li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                           <li>Practical: Tractable tooling/data manipulation requirements
                              
                              <ul>
                                 <li>We can confirm with tools that an instance conforms to the recommendations.</li>
                                 <li>Existing tools and applications, either in their current form or with reasonable enhancements, can produce the recommended
                                    instances.
                                 </li>
                                 <li>Model does not require a combinatorial explosion of pre-coordinated concepts. For example, the model should not require the
                                    creation of the cross product of "Allergic to" and all drugs and substances.

                           <li>Not superfluous: Where more than one approach appears to be viable and broadly equal in respect of the criteria above a single
                              approach is recommended to avoid unnecessary divergence.

                                       In cases where an observation results in a non-numeric result this can also be represented using a SNOMED CT expression. Actions
                                       involving measurement or a property or observation of a specified quality can readily be represented unambiguously using this
                                       pair of attributes.

                                    <p>Some kinds of observation are typically expressed in a way that either does not specify the action but merely asserts a result
                                       (or finding). In these cases the asserted result is fully specified and does not require a detailed indication of the action
                                       taken (e.g. "abdomen tender", "past history of renal colic", etc). SNOMED CT supports representation of these assertions in
                                       a single expression using concepts from the [ &lt;&lt;404684003 | clinical finding ] and [ 413350009 | finding with explicit context
                                       ] hierarchies. Several different ways of representing the same information thus exist using different combinations of the
                                       Act.code and Observation.value. Unconstrained use of the alternatives presents a major challenge for computation of semantic
                                       equivalence and that for safe interpretation of observations origination from different applications and users.<strong></strong><strong></strong></p>

                                                Further more, such misinterpretation might fundamentally alter the intended meaning. The SNOMED CT Concept Model and HL7 attributes

                                       about clinical findings&#8221; are represented has been a source of considerable discussion within HL7. This discussion focuses
                                       on the way in which the coded representation of such statements is expressed in the Observation.code&#8221; and Observation.value&#8221;
                                       attributes of the Observation class.

                                    <p>Statements about clinical findings can be divided into two categories.  </p>

                                    <p>Examples:

                                          </li>
                                          <li>Body weight (1) = 75 Kg (2) 
                                             <ul>
                                                <li>This example is not in line with strict interpretation of the formal RIM definition in which the Observation.code is the action
                                                   taken to make the observation. However, it is a more familiar form in real-world clinical statements about many observations.
                                                   A possible bridge between these two views is to regard the name of the property observed (e.g. [ 27113001 | body weight ])
                                                   as implying the action to measure or observe that property (e.g. [ 39857003 | weighing patient ]).

                                          <li>The term "nominalized" is used to indicate a statement reduced to a single name (or term) which can then be coded as a single
                                             expression.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>The fact that a statement is often nominalized does not mean it consists of a single atomic item of information. Many such
                                             statements can be readily divided into several identifiable facets. However, unlike statements of type A, there are different
                                             views on how the semantics of the facets of these statements might be divided between the &#8220;code&#8221; and/or &#8220;value&#8221; attributes
                                             of the observation class.
                                          </li>
                                       </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Examples:  The following examples are statements that might appear in clinical records. In each case they assert a finding
                                       in relation to the &#8220;record target&#8221;. Each of these examples illustrates a particular aspect of the potential for nominalizing
                                       a statement.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p><em>Record target &#8230;</em><ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                                          <li>has a fracture of her left femur     </li>
                                          <li>is complaining of pain in his right knee for the last two days</li>
                                          <li>reports that she had a heart attack in January 2001</li>
                                          <li>may have pernicious anemia</li>
                                          <li>has an aortic ejection murmur</li>
                                          <li>has normal visual acuity</li>

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Type (A) statements can be readily represented using the Observation class as documented in the RIM. However, a variety of
                                       options have been considered for type (B) "nominalized" statements. These options vary in the use they make of the Observation.code
                                       and Observation.value attributes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In summary the options considered included
                                       <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                                          <li>Using only one of the attributes to represent the nominalized meaning of the statement and omitting the other attribute.</li>
                                          <li>Applying a fixed value to one of the attributes and using the other one to represent the nominalized meaning of the statement.</li>
                                          <li>Using the value to represent the nominalized meaning of the statement while allowing the other code to operate independently
                                             to track the question or process without affecting the meaning of the result to the observation.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>Creating a separate class for nominalized statement rather than using the Observation class.</li>
                                       </ul>A joint meeting of the HL7 Modeling and Methodology and Vocabulary Technical Committees was asked to rule on the validity
                                       of these options. The discussions of these committees led to a decision to clarify the RIM definition of the Observation class.
                                       The clarification made clear that both Observation.code and Observation.value should be present and should be interpreted
                                       together rather than independently. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>As a result the preferred option is for a fixed Observation.code value "ASSERTION" to be used and for the meaning of the nominalized
                                       statement to be conveyed in the Observation.value. All other options are deprecated but some of these are permitted for backward
                                       compatibility. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The options permitted for backward compatibility are those that are known to be in use and these are supported as far as possible
                                       with transformation rules to allow the preferred form to be derived for comparison. There is a practical limitation to the
                                       transformation rules where code and value are used independently because it may not be possible to confirm computationally
                                       whether the code was intended to significantly modify the meaning of the value.

                                       of the Act.moodCode.
                                       <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                                          <li>The most general HL7 Act.statusCode values ("NORMAL", "OBSOLETE" and "NULLIFIED") relate to whether the Act class instance
                                             is currently valid. These states do not result in any overlaps with SNOMED CT semantics.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>Other states overlap with aspects of SNOMED CT semantics in a manner that is to some extent dependent on the mood of the Act.</li>

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Unlike the other attributes discussed in this section the value of the statusCode may progress over time. Thus the fact that
                                       a "request" was aborted implies that a request was made, as well as indicating that the request was not acted upon. Therefore,
                                       the impact of a Act.statusCode on SNOMED CT semantics depends on whether the concern is to know what steps were taken or to
                                       know whether a step was completed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The relevance of statusCode is fairly clear cut when the Act.moodCode value is "EVN", since this implies an actual occurrence.
                                       In these cases, the statusCode pertains to whether the event is complete and thus directly to the SNOMED CT [ 408730004 |
                                       procedure context ].

                                    <p>In other moods,  this relationship is less clear. For example, the Act.statusCode applies to an Act with moodCode "RQO" refers
                                       to the status of the request, whereas the [ 408730004 | procedure context ] refers to the progress of the concept specified
                                       by the [ 363589002 | associated procedure ].

                                       of the impact of a statusCode on aspects of semantics depends on whether the requirement is to know 'what steps were taken'
                                       or 'whether a step was completed'. Thus the fact that a "request" was aborted implies that a request was made, as well as
                                       indicating that the request was not taken through to normal completion.

                                       <blockquote>Most observation target sites are implied by the observation definition and Act.code, or Observation.value. For example, "heart

                                    <p>The notes following the Procedure.targetSiteCode definition are perhaps a little less clear cut. However, they convey a similar
                                       general sense.
                                       <blockquote>Some target sites can also be "pre-coordinated" in the Act definition, so that there is never an option to select different
                                          body sites. The same information structure can handle both the pre-coordinated and the post-coordinated approach.

                                    <p>Therefore, if the Procedure.code or Observation.code specifies the site to a sufficient level of detail, there is no requirement

                                       not support SNOMED CT post-coordination. In this case, requiring these attributes to be encoded using SNOMED CT and interpreted
                                       as refinements of the relevant SNOMED CT attributes, enables a simple transformation to the recommended form.

                                    <p>The notes following the Procedure.approachSiteCode definition suggest that the intent is not to repeat the approach if it
                                       is fixed by the nature of the procedure specified by the Act.code.
                                       <blockquote>Some [ 260669005 | approach ]  sites can also be "pre-coordinated" in the Act definition, so that there is never an option
                                          to select different body sites. The same information structure can handle both the pre-coordinated and the post-coordinated

                                    <p>Therefore, if the Procedure.code or SubstanceAdministration.code specifies the [ 260669005 | approach ]  to a sufficient level
                                       of detail, there is no requirement to include a separate approachSiteCode attribute. When using SNOMED CT post-coordination
                                       to refine the [ 260669005 | approach ] , the Act.code can specify the approach to the same level of detail as can be achieved
                                       using the approachSiteCode attribute.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The vocabulary domain specified for approachSiteCode is ActSite which is the same as the vocabulary domain for targetSiteCode.
                                       In contrast SNOMED CT uses a specific value hierarchy for approaches which is different from the one used for [ 363698007
                                       | finding site ] or [ &lt;&lt;363704007 | procedure site ]. The distinction is that an approach is a route used to reach a target
                                       site rather than a specific structural landmark that represents a point on or part of that route. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       The example values in the approachSiteCode include a mixture of approaches (e.g. "trans-abdominal approach" and "retroperitoneal
                                       approach") which fit the idea of approach as used by SNOMED CT. However, references to the punctured area of skin or structural
                                       landmarks have a significantly different semantic quality. Many sites are never the names of routes, several routes may pass
                                       through a single site and a route may pass through several sites. Therefore attempts to combine SNOMED CT and HL7 representations
                                       of approach may result in confusion rather than clarity.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The recommendation to use the SNOMED CT representation of [ 260669005 | approach ] is based on the more appropriate range
                                       of values available for this attribute, and on the fact that many procedure concepts pre-coordinate an implied or explicitly
                                       stated approach. Omission of the HL7 approachSiteCode attribute is recommended to avoid the redundancy and the potential for
                                       conflicts between the two forms of representation of site. However, while the use of these HL7 attributes is deprecated, it
                                       is permitted to support use in environments that do not support SNOMED CT post-coordination. In this case, requiring the approachSiteCode
                                       attributes to be encoded using SNOMED CT and interpreted as refinements of the SNOMED CT [ 260669005 | approach ] , enables
                                       a simple transformation to the recommended form.

                                       The notes following the definition of Observation.methodCode make it clear that the intent is not to repeat a method implied
                                       by the Act.code.
                                       <blockquote>
                                          In all observations the method is already partially specified by simply knowing the kind of observation (observation definition,
                                          Act.code) and this implicit information about the method does not need to be specified in Observation.methodCode.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>The notes following the Procedure.methodCode are less explicit about avoidance of duplication. However, they do suggest that
                                       code systems might be designed with relationships between procedures and possible method &#8211; which is exactly how SNOMED CT
                                       is designed. What the note does not take into account is that the terminology may also specify a way to represent a specific
                                       method with the procedure in a single code or expression.
                                       <blockquote>
                                          '&#8230;  a code system might be designed such that it specifies a set of available methods for each defined Procedure concept'
                                       </blockquote>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Therefore, if the Act.code or Observation.value specifies the method to a sufficient level of detail, there is no requirement
                                       to include a separate methodCode attribute. When using SNOMED CT post-coordination to refine the method, the Act.code or Observation.value
                                       specifies the method to the same level of detail as can be achieved using the methodCode.

                                    <p>
                                       The notes on methodCode use "open" and "laparoscopic" procedures as examples of differences in method. SNOMED CT makes this
                                       same differentiation using another defining attribute [ 260507000 | access ]. This highlights the potential for confusion
                                       from using both SNOMED and HL7 representations of method.

                                       priorities for processing them based on perceived clinical need or other factors. On the other hand, some emergency procedures
                                       are carried out directly without a specific request and thus without the normal workflow associated with prioritization.

                                    <p>The use of a distinct information model attribute (i.e. Act.priorityCode), which is applicable to all services, makes the
                                       priority more readily accessible to workflow management. It does not require the SNOMED CT expression to be parsed to determine
                                       the priority of a request or action. In addition, it allows consistent handling of priority when some services are represented
                                       using SNOMED CT while others are represented using different code systems.

                                    <p>The use of a representation of priority that is integrated with the definition model of the associated concept is more useful
                                       from the perspective of clinical record retrieval. The description logic model of SNOMED CT ensures the computational equivalence
                                       of a procedure concept defined as an emergency and a post-coordinated expression in which [ 260870009 | priority | = 25876001
                                       | emergency ]  is added to the more general procedure concept.

                                                interpretation. This mapping table would need to specify combinations of moodCode and negationInd. For example, negationInd=true
                                                with moodCode=&#8220;EVN&#8221; the would imply [ 408730004 | procedure context | = 85660001 | not done ], whereas negationInd=true with

                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The simplest way to avoid these possible misunderstandings is to omit the negationInd attribute and allow the SNOMED CT context
                                       attributes to provide information about absent findings and procedures that have not been done. However, to meet requirements
                                       to support some simple negation in systems that do not support the SNOMED CT context model, use of negationInd is permitted
                                       where it cannot be misinterpreted . The only cases where no risk of misinterpretation are where the SNOMED CT context is either
                                       unspecified or explicitly states the default values [ 410515003 | known present ] or [ 385658003 | done ]. The negationInd
                                       can be used to switch these defaults to the appropriate negated values such as [ 410516002 | known absent ] and  [ 85660001
                                       | not done ].

                                    <p>The SNOMED CT [ 408730004 | procedure context ] does not contain values to represent "possibly done" or "probably done". As
                                       a result there is no obvious way to express uncertainty about whether a procedure has been done. This may be relevant if an
                                       informer reports something like "I think I had a tetanus vaccination but I am not sure". The current advice is to treat such
                                       information as an Observation about past history, rather than adding uncertainty value to the [ 408730004 | procedure context
                                       ] value hierarchy. However, this issue has been raised with the SNOMED Concept Model Working Group and the advice may be revised
                                       if after further consideration the [ 408730004 | procedure context ] value set is expanded.

                                    <p>The HL7 UVP (Uncertain Value - Probabilistic) data type was considered as this as another HL7 approach to representation of
                                       uncertainty. The UVP data type is defined as "A generic data type extension used to specify a probability expressing the information
                                       producer's belief that the given value holds." The data types specification adds that "How the probability number was arrived
                                       at is outside the scope of this specification."  There is some potential for overlap as the UVP data type is a "generic data
                                       type extension". This means it can be applied to any other data type, and hence to any HL7 attribute.  This data type may
                                       be applied to attribute values associated with a SNOMED CT code. For example, to express uncertainty associated with the value
                                       of a particular measurement. However, use of UVP to apply a specific level of uncertainty to a SNOMED CT concept in an Act
                                       should be avoided.

                                    <p>Use of UCUM representation simplifies interoperability using HL7 messages. The UCUM specification also supports translation
                                       between different types of units. It is possible to map from SNOMED CT concepts to UCUM in all cases except those where an
                                       informal unit is specified. On the other hand, since the UCUM representation is an expression syntax it can be used to represent
                                       an almost unlimited range of complex units in a formal mathematical manner. Many of the units that can potentially be represented
                                       in UCUM have no pre-coordinated equivalent in SNOMED CT. SNOMED post-coordination does not currently support the type of mathematical

                                       CT [ 408731000 | temporal context ] and any specific point or period of time expressed in Act.effectiveTime should be consistent
                                       with one another. The rules do not permit the effectiveTime and [ 408731000 | temporal context ] to be interpreted in a combinatorially
                                       manner. Thus if the [ 408731000 | temporal context | = 410513005 | past ] the Act.effectiveTime, if stated, must be the point

                                    <p>In general SNOMED CT expressions (whether pre-coordinated or post-coordinated) are most appropriate for expressing multiple
                                       facets of a single logical concept. On the other hand, HL7 ActRelationships are more appropriate for making associations between
                                       multiple distinct observations or procedures. However, this boundary is fuzzy and there are many situations in which either
                                       approach may have equal merit. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The use of SNOMED CT attributes may result in arbitrarily complex statements that wrap multiple distinct findings within a
                                       single terminological expression. In these cases, the use of separate coded statements linked by Act Relationships is preferable.
                                       On the other hand, use of multiple statements linked by ActRelationships to represent a single composite finding or procedure
                                       may result in loss of the natural clinical term used by a clinician within a collection or linked classes.

                                    <p>Even when the guidelines above are followed, there will be grey areas. In an ideal world rule would be devised to compute
                                       equivalence between single Act class instances containing a post-coordinated SNOMED CT expressions and multiple Act class
                                       instances. While this is theoretically possible, there are several practical obstacles. The HL7 vocabulary for the ActRelationship.typeCode
                                       attribute differs from the range of values for linkage attributes in SNOMED CT.  Simple precise or close mappings exist for
                                       some values but more work is needed before we can assert full semantic interoperability between the two representations. In
                                       addition, while a single instance post-coordinated representation has a single life-history the individual instances in multiple
                                       class representation may have separate life histories and separate associations with other contextual information.

                                       of a procedure or finding is a person (or other entity) related to the subject of the record. This facility is used to define
                                       some SNOMED CT concepts (e.g. "family history of asthma" has [ 408732007 | subject relationship context ] = [ 303071001 |
                                       person in the family ]). The same attribute can also be used to create post-coordinated expressions. For example, it can be

                                       ] and also has an association to a specific subject. For example, if the concept [ 160303001 | FH: diabetes mellitus ] is
                                       stated in an observation linked to a person other than the subject of the record, this could mean either (a) "the patient
                                       has a family history of diabetes, in the named family member" or (b) "the identified subject has a family history of diabetes".

                                    <p>Propagation of context is valuable and in some cases almost essential, as it reduces the need to duplicate contextual information.
                                       However, it is not entirely clear whether and if so how this propagation of context applies to coded information in each Act
                                       instance. Safe interpretation of clinical information requires a common understanding of where contextual information represented
                                       using SNOMED CT if either Act.code or Observation.value propagates to related Acts based on the context propagation rules.
                                       For example, several Observations coded using SNOMED CT disorder concepts might be related as component parts of an Organizer
                                       labeled with the SNOMED CT code "family history of disorder". If the coded context propagated it might seem to express a family
                                       history, if not these might be part of the personal medical history of the subject of record.

                                    <p>It is not clear how context conduction is intended to apply to contextual information that is represented in concepts within
                                       an Act. If this type of context is assumed to propagate it would mean that the meaning of a single Observation might be fundamentally
                                       altered by a related Act (or potentially by a chain of several different related Acts). This type of dependency presents significant
                                       risks, since different systems may be unable to reproducibly determine the composite meaning. Therefore, it seems safest to
                                       recommend restatement of the essential aspects of context as defined by the SNOMED CT context model rather than permitting
                                       this context to conduct.

                                    <p>There may be some specific cases, where a tightly coupled set of Acts are expected to behave as a block with regard to the
                                       surrounding context and where some or all aspects of context represented using SNOMED CT also need to be conducted. In these
                                       cases the potential for misinterpretation needs to be considered and appropriately documented.

                              <p>The RIM defines the abstract ActClass "ActClassRecordOrganizer" as a navigational structure or heading used to group a set
                                 of acts sharing a common context. Record organizers include 
                                 					such structures as folders, documents, document sections, and batteries. The Clinical Statement model includes an Organizer
                                 class, whose class code can be valued with 
                                 					an ActClassRecordOrganizer subtype. Where the Organizer class is used, the value of Organizer.code <strong>MAY</strong> be drawn from the 
                                 					SNOMED CT [ (&lt;&lt;419891008 | Record artifact | ) OR (&lt;&lt;386053000 | Evaluation procedure | ) ] hierarchies.<a name="fn-src9"></a><a href="#fn9"><sup style="font-size: smaller">9</sup></a>

                              <p>It is often the case that there is a close correspondence between a particular kind of clinical statement (e.g. a blood pressure
                                 reading) and the organizer where the clinical statement is commonly found (e.g. a vital signs section). The patterns presented
                                 here are irrespective of and not dependent on the organizer in which they are found. Thus, the pattern for allergies and adverse
                                 reactions should be used regardless of any organizers they may or may not be contained in; and any distinction between a finding
                                 vs. disorder vs. diagnosis needs to be made explicit in the clinical statement itself, without reliance on the containing
                                 organizer. Stated in another way, a clinical statement needs to be a correct assertion by itself, when viewed outside the

                                    <p>In this example, the observation is simply the assertion of a "headache". If there is a need to distinguish between, say,
                                       a patient-reported symptom vs. a clinician-asserted diagnosis, more information would need to be present. Thus, while an acceptable
                                       pattern is to assert a clinical finding, that may not convey sufficient context for all communication use cases. Likewise,
                                       an assertion of a procedure.code (such as for an appendectomy performed 5 years ago) doesn't distinguish between a patient's
                                       reported past surgical history vs. information gleaned from chart review, and additional contextual information will be needed
                                       in some cases.

                                 					Another recurring issue for many clinical statements is the representation of how the information in that statement was
                                 obtained (e.g. patient-reported symptom, gleaned from chart review, physical exam finding). Whether or not the source of information
                                 needs to be included in a particular communication is outside the scope of this guide, but in some cases, such as the recording
                                 of patient medications, knowing the source of the information can have significant clinical implications, and since there
                                 are overlaps in HL7 and SNOMED CT representations, the topic is addressed in this guide.

                                       Therefore it won't often be necessary to directly assert a finding informer of patient.

                           An assessment scale is a collection of observations that together yield a summary evaluation of a particular condition. Examples
                           include the Braden Scale (used for assessing pressure ulcer risk), APACHE Score (used for estimating mortality in critically
                           ill patients), Mini-Mental Status Exam (used to assess cognitive function), APGAR Score (used to assess the health of a newborn),
                           and Glasgow Coma Scale (used for assessment of coma and impaired consciousness.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Assessment scales share certain features, which are described here as part of a recommended pattern:

                        <ol>
                           <li>Assessment scales have one or more component observations that can be taken in aggregate to provide an overall score (e.g.
                              [ 248241002 | Glasgow Coma score ]).

                           <li>Assessment scale component observations can be represented as a question and answer (e.g. [ 248240001 | Motor response ] =
                              "3") or as a finding (e.g. [ 85157005 | Decorticate posture ]). Either or both of these representations may need to be communicated,
                              depending on the use case.

                        <p>The aggregate observation is modeled as a component of the assessment procedure. The &lt;derivationExpr&gt; can contain a formal
                           language expression specifying how the value is computed. Component observations are nested under the aggregate observation,
                           linked with a "DRIV" (is derived from) relationship. Where a component observation needs to be communicated in different formats,
                           each format is a discrete observation, linked by a "XFRM" relationship.

                           Observations, Conditions, Diagnoses, and Concerns are often confused, but in fact have distinct definitions and patterns.

                           <li>"Observation" and "Condition": An HL7 observation is something noted and recorded as an isolated event, whereas an HL7 condition
                              is an ongoing event. Symptoms and findings (also know as signs) are observations. The distinction between "seizure" and "epilepsy"
                              or between "allergic reaction" and "allergy" is that the former is an observation, and the latter is a condition.<br /><br />SNOMED CT distinguishes between "Clinical Findings" and "Diseases", where a SNOMED CT disease is a kind of SNOMED CT clinical
                              finding that is necessarily abnormal:<br /><br /><ul>
                                 <li>[ 404684003 | Clinical finding ]
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>[ 64572001 | Disease ]</li>

                                 </li>
                              </ul><br />The SNOMED CT finding/disease distinction is orthogonal to the HL7 observation/condition distinction, thus a SNOMED CT finding
                              or disease can be an HL7 observation or condition.<br /><br /></li>
                           <li>
                              "Diagnosis": The term "diagnosis" has many clinical and administrative meanings in healthcare
                              
                              <ul>
                                 <li>A diagnosis is the result of a cognitive process whereby signs, symptoms, test results, and other relevant data are evaluated
                                    to determine the condition afflicting a patient.
                                 </li>
                              </ul>

                                 <li>A diagnosis often directs administrative and clinical workflow, where for instance the assertion of an admission diagnosis
                                    establishes care paths, order sets, etc.
                                 </li>

                                 <li>A diagnosis is often something that is billed for in a clinical encounter. In such a scenario, an application typically has
                                    a defined context where the billable object gets entered. <br /><br /></li>

                           </li>
                           <li>"Concern": A concern is something that a clinician is particularly interested in and wants to track. It has important patient
                              management use cases (e.g. health records often present the problem list or list of concerns as a way of summarizing a patient's
                              medical history). 
                           </li>

                           Differentiation of Observation, Condition, Diagnosis, and Concern in common patterns:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                           <li>"Observation" and "Condition": The distinction between an HL7 Observation and HL7 Condition is made by setting the Act.classCode
                              to "OBS" or "COND", respectively. The distinction between a SNOMED finding and SNOMED disease is based on the location of
                              the concept in the SNOMED CT hierarchy. There is no flag in a clinical statement instance for distinguishing between a SNOMED
                              CT finding vs. disease.<br /><br /></li>
                           <li>"Diagnosis": 
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Result of a cognitive process: Could potentially be Indicated by post-coordinating a SNOMED CT finding method attribute with
                                    a procedure such as "cognitive process".
                                 </li>
                              </ul>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Directs administrative and clinical workflow: These use cases typically rely more on the context in which the diagnoses are
                                    entered (e.g. where an order set has a field designated for the admission diagnosis). In such a case, the distinction of a
                                    (particular kind of) diagnosis is that it occurs within a particular organizer (e.g. a condition within an Admission Diagnosis
                                    section is an admission diagnosis from an administrative perspective). 
                                    															
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>Something that is billed for: The fact that something was billed for would be expressed in another HL7 message. There is nothing
                                          in the pattern for a diagnosis that says whether or not it was or can be billed for. <br /><br /></li>
                                    </ul>
                                 </li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                           <li>"Concern": The HL7 Patient Care Technical Committee is developing a formal model for condition tracking. In that model, a
                              problem (which may be an Observation, a Procedure, or some other type of Act) is wrapped in an Act with a new Act.classCode
                              &#8220;CONCERN&#8221;. The focus in this guide is on the use of SNOMED CT, whereas the Patient Care condition tracking model is the definitive
                              source for the overall structure of a problem list.
                              					
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It should be noted that the administrative representation of a diagnosis and the representation of a concern break the rules
                           from section &#8206;3.1.1 Observations vs. Organizers, in that these designations are based on context, whereas the designation
                           of something as an Observation vs. Condition is inherent in the clinical statement itself.

                  <p>Every application has its own data entry screens, workflow, internal database design, and other nuances, and yet despite this,
                     we talk of semantic interoperability. In order to achieve interoperability, and enable a receiver to aggregate data coming
                     from any of a number of applications, it must be possible to compare data generated on any of these applications. In order
                     to compare data, it helps to imagine a canonical or normal form. If all data, regardless of how it was captured, can be converted
                     into a common form, it becomes possible to compare.

                  <p>
                     To that end, we differentiate the "model of use" from the "model of meaning", where the former represents the way in which
                     the data was captured, and the latter represents a common representation. All representations recommended in this guide can
                     be converted into a common model of meaning. This common model of meaning can be expressed in a SNOMED CT normal form and/or
                     a RIM Normal Form, thereby enabling data comparisons.

                        <p>The text below is taken from the introduction to the document 'SNOMED CT Transformations to Normal Forms', and outlines the
                           purpose of transformations and the general method of transformation. This document, and its companion '     SNOMED CT Abstract
                           Models and Representational Forms' can be found at <a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/our-standards/technical-documents/">http://www.ihtsdo.org/our-standards/technical-documents/</a>. From the perspective of integration of SNOMED CT expressions in HL7 communications the assumption is that in most cases
                           a "close to user" form will be stored and communicated. The normal form transformation provides a method that enables consistent
                           comparison of these expressions with one another and with retrieval queries.
                        </p>
                        <p>The purpose of generating normal forms is to facilitate complete and accurate retrieval of pre and post-coordinated SNOMED
                           CT expressions from clinical records or other resources. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The approach described is based on the description logic definitions of SNOMED CT concepts which are used when recording clinical
                           statements in an electronic records system. Using this approach, expressions that are authored, stored and/or communicated
                           in a relatively informal close-to-user form are logically transformed into a common normalized form. In this normalized form
                           it is possible to apply simple rules to test subsumption between expressions.
                        </p>
                        <p>The simplest case of a valid close-to-user expression is a single conceptId, and the approach described can be applied to
                           these simple pre-coordinated expressions, as well as to more complex expressions that include multiple conceptIds and refinements
                           (qualifiers). 
                        </p>
                        <p>Likewise, transformations and normalisations can be both simple and complex, however the general principle is that the normalisation
                           process will restate a SNOMED CT expression in terms of the 'primitive' Concepts with which it is associated in the reference
                           data. By example, the SNOMED CT Concept [ 80146002 | appendectomy ] would, in essence, transform under normalisation to [
                           71388002 | procedure |: { 260686004 | method |= 129304002 | excision - action |, 405813007 | procedure site - Direct |= 66754008
                           | appendix structure | } ] ("a procedure that consists of excising an appendix").

                        <p>The approach to normalization may be applied to the specific SNOMED CT expressions but may also be extended to take account
                           of contextual information derived from the information model in which the expression is situated. Therefore, the normal form
                           may include SNOMED CT context information, even if this is not present in the initial SNOMED CT expression. As such the result
                           of transformation of [ 80146002 | appendectomy ] is a simplification (the additional contextual/situation information is missing),
                           but it is hoped that the example sufficiently illustrates the principle of normalisation.

                                    <p>A large clinical terminology, such as SNOMED CT, represents a number of lexically similar concepts which are grammatically,
                                       linguistically or semantically distinct. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced if the terminology is considered without
                                       any kind of partitioning. The coarse-grained partitioning specified by these constraints simplifies and clarifies decisions

                                                <li>The reference to "adverse drugs reaction" may suggest use of subtypes of the procedure concept [ &lt;&lt;396079007 | assessment

                                                <li>The reference to "drug" may suggest concepts in the use of subtypes of [ &lt;&lt;373873005 | pharmaceutical / biologic product ]

                                       In most cases, the simple value set constraints in this specification apply to this clinical focus concept. In combination
                                       with the SNOMED CT concept model these constraints form a foundation for more detailed "complete" value set specifications
                                       (as explored in <a href="#TerminfoAppendVocdom">Detailed aspects of issues with a vocabulary specification formalism

                                    <p>Simple value set constraints can be regarded as a set of subsumption clauses related by OR logic. Each clause permits the
                                       inclusion of a focus concept that is subsumed by a specified concept. In contrast, a more complete specification would check
                                       normal form transformations of candidate expressions against a variety of subsumption and role-based restrictions. In addition
                                       a complete specification require support of a full set of logical operators between clauses (i.e. OR, AND, NOT).

                                    <p>For example, consider a value-set constraint which indicates that the "focus concept" must be a kind of [ &lt;&lt;404684003 | clinical

                                       may contain SNOMED CT content that, while active at the time of entry, have subsequently been rendered inactive in the reference
                                       data(e.g. as a result of recognition or errors such as duplication or ambiguity). In these cases value set testing SHOULD
                                       include analysis of information contained in the SNOMED CT history data. Such data will assist in establishing the relationship(s)
                                       between inactive concepts and active concepts. If it can be demonstrated that an inactive concept has an appropriate historical
                                       relationship to a value set valid active concept, and if the specification does not explicitly exclude inactive concepts,
                                       then the inactive concept should be regarded as valid for communication.

                                    <p>For example, consider the concept [ 274638001 | asthenia ], which is now marked as an inactive duplicate in SNOMED CT. This
                                       concept may have been active in the past, and may thus have been used in the creation a record entry. This historical record
                                       entry may subsequently be communicated (perhaps as part of a record extract), by which time the concept has been marked as
                                       inactive. If this is encountered it is possible (by analysis of the SNOMED CT history data) to identify the [ 168666000 |
                                       SAME AS ] relationship to the active concept [ 13791008 | asthenia ]. Assuming the message specification does not explicitly
                                       exclude inactive concepts it is then possible to test the (active) concept for suitability in the message instance and accept
                                       it as valid.

                        <p>This section outlines the general options for dealing with overlaps in semantics between an information model and terminology
                           model. It considers the advantages and disadvantages of requiring, prohibiting or allowing either or both of two overlapping
                           forms of representation.

                        <p>The discussion in this section is applicable to the potential overlaps between any information model and any terminology.
                           It was used as the basis for the consideration of specific overlaps between HL7 and SNOMED CT semantics in <a href="#TerminfoOverlap">Guidance on Overlaps between RIM and SNOMED CT Semantics

                        <p>Table 1 considers the interplay between three rules (required, optional and prohibited) that might in theory be applied to
                           the use of HL7 and a terminology representations in each case where there is an overlap. For each optional rule two potential
                           instances are considered &#8211; presence and absence of the optional element. The intersection of the rules and instances result
                           in a total of sixteen potential cases. In half these cases there is no difficulty because there is no actual overlap. The
                           remaining cases create either a requirement to manage duplication or some a requirement to enforce a prohibition imposed by
                           the relevant rule. 
                           The general issues related to different types of prohibition or duplicate management are considered below. These general considerations
                           are then applied to specific areas of overlap.

                        <p>Any prohibition of an HL7 representation that overlaps with a terminology representation is unconditional if the corresponding
                           Terminology representation is required. However, if the terminology representation is optional, the prohibition is conditional
                           and does not apply unless the terminology representation is present.

                        <p>
                           Some unconditional prohibitions may be sufficiently generalized to be modeled by excluding a particular attribute or association
                           from the relevant model. If a prohibition is conditional, other constraints (e.g. a restricted vocabulary domain) or implementation
                           guidelines (e.g. textual supporting material) may be more necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>Any prohibition needs to be expressed in a way that does not undermine support for any required communications of data encoded
                           using other code systems. In most cases, the universal HL7 standards for a domain should support conditional prohibition.
                           This allows some realms or communities to enforce prohibition, while allowing others to use alternative code systems.

                        <p>
                           Prohibition of a terminology representation is fraught with difficulties. If a particular terminology representation is recorded
                           in a sending system, prohibiting the inclusion of that expression in an HL7 message prevents faithful communication of original
                           structured clinical information. Transformation of a terminology representation into an HL7 syntactic form such as the Concept
                           Descriptor (CD) data type should be possible for most if not all terminologies. It has been argued that disaggregating a post-coordinated
                           Terminology representation across multiple HL7 attributes (e.g. assigning SNOMED "procedure site" to the HL7 Procedure.targetSiteCode)
                           is a similar kind of transformation. However, this presumes a one-to-one match between the semantics of the Terminology representation
                           and the specific HL7 attribute. In many cases this mapping will be less precise as a terminology may have more or less finely
                           grained attributes than those present in the RIM (e.g. SNOMED CT includes "procedure site &#8211; direct" and "procedure sit &#8211; indirect").
                           As a terminology continues to evolves more of these distinct attributes are likely to be added increasing the information
                           loss from transforms of this type.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           A general prohibition of use of valid terminology representations is likely to form an obstacle to communication rather than
                           encouraging semantic interoperability. However, guidelines on specific topics within a domain may recommend use of HL7 representations
                           rather than or in addition to Terminology representations. These guidelines will be most effective if implemented in the design
                           of data entry and storage rather than restricted by communication specifications.

                        <p>If HL7 and terminology representations of a similar characteristic are permitted to co-exist, there is a requirement for rules
                           that determine how duplicate, refined and different meanings are validated or combined. Table 2 outlines the general types
                           of rules that might be applied. The rules in this table form a framework for discussion of specific recommendations related

                           overlap are clear and unambiguous. Applying different rules based on convenience of a particular representational form in
                           a particular environment, domain or use case is liable to lead to serious misinterpretation information flows between environments.
                           Furthermore, every variation in the rules will require additional processing overhead and implementer understanding.

                        <p>This document uses the SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar to refer to SNOMED CT concepts and expressions. <a href="#TerminfoAppendRefsCg">Table
                              			11</a> provides an overview of this grammar which is intended to meet the needs of readers of this document. However, those with
                           a more detailed interest in this topic should read the "SNOMED CT Guide to Abstract Models and Representational Forms" available
                           at <a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/our-standards/technical-documents/">http://www.ihtsdo.org/our-standards/technical-documents/</a> which explains the underlying abstract model and includes a full BNF definition of the grammar.
                        </p>
                        <p>The abstract model of expressions and definitions that is at the heart of SNOMED CT. In contrast, the grammar is just one
                           way of representing instances of concepts, definitions and expressions. As noted in the <a href="#TerminfoSNOMEDPostCoord">Formal rules for post-coordinated expressions
                              			(§
                              			1.6.5.2 )</a>, there are other ways to represent expressions, including the HL7 Concept Descriptor data type. The reason for using the
                           compositional grammar in this document is that it offers a terse representation which is both human-readable and computer-processable.
                        </p>
                        <p>The grammar used in this document extends the SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar in two respects:</p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>To improve the clarity and processability of references to SNOMED CT concepts and expressions within blocks of narrative text:
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Compositional grammar expressions are separated from the text of the document by square brackets;</li>
                                 <li>The final display name delimiter is omitted (i.e. replaced by a closing square bracket).</li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                           <li>To enable simple representation of constrained value-sets of concepts and expressions based on post-coordinated refinement.
                              <ul>
                                 <li> To support clear documentation of relatively simple constraints, an informal extension has been made to the compositional
                                    grammar. This extended grammar is used in this document for pragmatic reasons. It has is not proposed as a formal extension
                                    to the SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar and has neither been discussed or approved by the IHTSDO (<a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org">http://www.ihtsdo.org</a>) or the wider SNOMED community. 
                                 </li>
                                 <li>An informal extension has been made to the compositional grammar to represent constraints. This extension includes:
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>Additional symbols specified in <a href="#TerminfoAppendRefsCgExt1">Table

                           From an operational perspective it may sometimes be desirable to constrain the forms of representation permitted within a
                           given community or realm. In these cases, additional constraints may be stated in an implementation profile.

                                    CT documentation is '...concepts that represent occurrences (excluding procedures and interventions).' The illustrative examples
                                    offered are [ 111056004 | flood ], [ 409495001 | bioterrorist attack ] and [ 8766005 | earthquake ]. Over progressive releases
                                    this class of SNOMED CT concepts includes an increasing number of 'clinical' concepts (in particular acquiring concepts that
                                    corresponding to ICD9 Chapter E, however (a) a distinction between 'occurrent' findings and events is unclear (e.g. [ 1912002

                                    specifications offered in section 5 Event accompanies findings in order to document various Observations - this satisfies
                                    the reasonable expectation to document, for example, that a 'fall' has been observed. However, one of the motivations for
                                    distinguishing 'events' from 'findings' was to prevent the use of certain event-type concepts in the creation of Observation-type
                                    record entries. It is therefore expected that, depending on the use case, [ 272379006 | event ] may be constrained out of
                                    more precise specifications.

                                          to 'negate' an Event, express uncertain Events or set Events as goals

                                       <li>b) Ontologically it is unclear what the distinction (in SNOMED CT) is between events and findings - the distinction may, for
                                          example, be that Findings are 'occurrent states' and Events are 'occurrent state change triggers', but if this is the case
                                          then a more comprehensive revision of content is required

                                       <li>c) if events and findings are both handled by the same 'Context model', then rightly 'Findings Context' should be renamed
                                          'Findings and/or Event Context', but more significantly, even if suitable values are present for logically representing events,
                                          the available terms may be inadequate - Findings (as states) can comfortably be spoken of as 'present' and 'absent', but Events
                                          may require a different vocabulary (e.g. as things that 'happen' or 'do not happen').

                           <li>A deprecated pattern of Act.code and Observation.value is described in sections 2.2.2.2 and 5.3.1, where Observation.value
                              is a SNOMED CT expression representing a [ &lt;&lt; 404684003 | clinical finding (finding) ] or a [ &lt;&lt; 413350009 | finding with
                              explicit context ] and Act.code is represented by a code other than "ASSERTION". No machine-readable guidance can currently
                              be provided that can satisfy the accompanying requirement that '...interpretation of the Act.code together with the Observation.value
                              does not yield a meaning that is substantially different from the meaning implied if the Act.code was "ASSERTION"'. Such a

                           be encountered if they are not addressed are as follows:

                           <li>The ability to specify post-coordination-accommodating &#8216;implicit Expression&#8217; value sets. It is already a common convention
                              in HL7 v3 messaging specifications to exploit the hierarchical nature of certain terminologies by referring to a value set
                              member and indicating that this member and the members that it subsumes should constitute an allowable value set. An extended
                              requirement refers to the ability to define value sets that will test the suitability of candidate SNOMED CT Expressions which
                              may have become valid as a result of post-coordinated attribute refinement, but would fail &#8216;simple implicit&#8217; validity testing
                              against &#8216;node&#8217; subsumption ('simple subsumption'). Failure to satisfy this requirement will principally result in false negative
                              (erroneous rejections) treatment of suitable post-coordinated expressions.
                           </li>
                           <li>The ability of value set specifications to allow the communication of 'Finding/Procedure/Observable entity'-based Expressions
                              as well as their post-coordinated &#8216;situation/context wrapped&#8217; and pre-coordinated 'context-dependent' or 'situation' counterparts
                              [SNOMED CT has recently renamed the top-level concept of 'context-dependent categories' (where can be found 'finding' and
                              'procedure' Concepts where nuances of status and state are explicit in the reference data) - the top-level Concept in this
                              chapter is now named 243796009|situation with explicit context (situation)|]. Failure to satisfy this requirement will commonly
                              result in false negative (erroneous rejection) treatment of suitable post-coordinated expressions and either false positive
                              (erroneous inclusion) or false negative treatment of pre-coordinated Expressions (depending on the value set specification
                              strategy adopted).

                        </ol>
                        <p>Neither of the above requirements can be satisfactorily supported by value set specifications that either simply enumerate

                                 high-level Concepts such as [ 404684003 | clinical finding ], [ 71388002 | procedure ] and [ 105590001 | substance ], each
                                 correspondingly subsuming thousands of pre-coordinated Concepts that are deemed to be &#8216;Findings&#8217;, &#8216;Procedures&#8217; or &#8216;Substances.&#8217;

                                 It is a property/requirement of the SNOMED CT classification process that a distinction is made between &#8216;Primitive&#8217; and &#8216;Defined&#8217;
                                 Concepts (put simply, only Defined [in terms of other Concepts] Concepts can acquire new, inferred sub-types as a result of
                                 the classification process), and whilst a high number of Defined Concepts is desirable for more complete classification, it
                                 is an inevitable feature of SNOMED CT that a number of Concepts need to be regarded as Primitive (to introduce nuances of
                                 the world against which &#8216;Defined&#8217; content can be formally differentiated).

                                 when the nature of the 'focus Concept' is known will indicate which types of refinement and which axes of 'context modification'
                                 can be applied. For example, if the 'focus Concept' is a member of the set specified by [ &lt;&lt;404684003 | clinical finding ],
                                 inspection of the concept model will tell us that the Concept can be modified by selecting/refining values for defining characteristics

                                 etc., and that the focus Concept can serve as the value of an [ 246090004 | associated finding ] attribute of a 'context/situation'
                                 wrapped post-coordinated Expression. Additional information which may influence appropriate aspects of model application are

                                 a 'procedure') and (2) the moodCode value of the relevant HL7 v3 class (as this will determine the detailed value applied
                                 to the respective attribute names [ 408729009 | finding context ] or [ 408730004 | procedure context ]).

                        <p>For many 'universal' specifications it will be possible to anticipate and provide a set of appropriate value set clauses that
                           would adequately accommodate, in a general sense, paired 'plain' pre-coordinated (Concepts specified in the sets [ &lt;&lt;404684003
                           | clinical finding ] and [ &lt;&lt;71388002 | procedure ]) and 'context/situation' ([ &lt;&lt;413350009 | finding with explicit context
                           ] and [ &lt;&lt;129125009 | procedure with explicit context ]) pre-coordinated Concepts. It may well be desirable to do this, as
                           there are many Concepts in the set specified by [ &lt;&lt;243796009 | situation with explicit context ] that represent useful clinical
                           notions, and also happen to represent some nuance of status or state (e.g. 'dizziness' is a 'finding' and 'dizziness present'
                           is an 'explicit situation' - the latter represented in SNOMED CT by [ 162260006 | dizziness present ]).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           For example we may wish to specify that both 'plain' clinical findings or their 'context/situation' counterparts are valid
                           value set members:
                           
                        </p>

                           </tr>
                        </table>
                        <p>Whilst not worrying about the details of moodCode/context bindings (not all pre-coordinated 'context/situation' Concepts would
                           be valid for all moodCode values), this notation would appear to suffice (specifying the paired &#8216;clinical finding&#8217; and the
                           &#8216;explicit situation' finding). However, consider the following more precise/refined 'simple' value set, consisting of a set
                           of 'plain' Concept clauses:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                           <li>((&lt;&lt;50043002 | disorder of respiratory system |) OR</li>
                           <li>(&lt;&lt;49601007 | disorder of cardiovascular system |) OR</li>
                           <li>(&lt;&lt;119292006 | disorder of gastrointestinal tract |))</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                           To reproduce the paired &#8216;simple &amp; situation&#8217; pattern here we also need pre-coordinated Concepts of the form:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                           <li>Respiratory system disorder with explicit context OR</li>
                           <li>Cardiovascular system disorder with explicit context OR</li>
                           <li>Gastrointestinal tract disorder with explicit context</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                           Even if these did exist as pre-coordinated Concepts (currently they do not) we may well run into the same pattern of problem
                           as in &#8216;Implicit Expression&#8217; value sets, since it will be possible to &#8216;make&#8217; a &#8216;Cardiovascular system disorder with explicit
                           context&#8217; Expression by post-coordinated refinement of a suitable 'context/situation' supertype.
                        </p>
                        <p>The second pattern of 'context/situation' representation (for example stating in a SNOMED CT Expression that a finding is
                           'present', or that a procedure was 'performed in the past on a family member') is the use of SNOMED CT's 'context/situation'
                           wrapper in the creation of Expressions. This has the effect of introducing a 'focus Concept' from the set specified by [ &lt;&lt;243796009
                           | situation with explicit context ] and the nesting (as the value of the respective attributes [ 246090004 | associated finding
                           ] or [ 363589002 | associated procedure ]) of the 'clinical kernel' Expression.
                        </p>
                        <p>Re-using the 'dizziness' example, it is possible to document 'dizziness present' by both the use of the existing pre-coordinated
                           'context/situation' Concept ([ 162260006 | dizziness present ]) and by the following Expression [ 373573001 | clinical finding
                           present |: 246090004 | associated finding |= 404640003 | dizziness ]). A value set specification that is looking for subtypes
                           of 'dizziness' (the 'finding') and 'dizziness present' (the 'situation') (by the specification [ ((&lt;&lt;404640003 | dizziness
                           |) OR (&lt;&lt;162260006 | dizziness present |))] ) would inappropriately reject this Expression if only the 'focus Concept' [ 373573001
                           | clinical finding present ] was tested.
                        </p>

                                 We therefore have two patterns of problem:
                              </p>
                              <ol>
                                 <li>For pre-coordinated content, where explicit context/situation variants should also be allowed, we will need pre-coordinated
                                    'situation with explicit context' Concepts that may well not exist
                                 </li>
                                 <li>Where post-coordination is allowed we also need specifications to accommodate content that has 'become valid' as a result
                                    of
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>refinement of 'plain' Concepts</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>refinement of 'context/situation' Concepts</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>'context/situation wrapping' of 'plain' Concepts</li>
                                    </ul>
                                 </li>
                              </ol>
                              <p>
                                 It therefore seems reasonable to regard value set specifications where post-coordination (by sub-type refinement or context/situation
                                 wrapping) is taking place as similar to predicate specification for post-coordinated data retrieval.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 With some modifications and additional tuning (see below) such &#8216;value set predicates&#8217; can be generated by processing pre-coordinated
                                 &#8216;simple&#8217; Concepts according to the published rules for SNOMED CT Expression transformation to normal forms. Without loss of
                                 precision this will result in specifications that will appropriately allow the communication of Expressions that would have
                                 been missed by simple subsumption testing.

                        <p>The following  sections include  suggested enhancements of the transformation rules for generating comparable value set testing
                           forms, and suggestions for an optimal representational formalism. It should be noted that the SNOMED Technical Design Team
                           are currently developing a specification for a machine-readable representation of the SNOMED CT Concept Model. It is likely
                           that there will be many similarities between a formalism for constraining what can and can't be said using the Concept Model
                           and constraining/specifying what patterns of Expression can and can't be communicated.
