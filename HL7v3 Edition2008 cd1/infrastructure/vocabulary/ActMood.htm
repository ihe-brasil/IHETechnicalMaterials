                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="vocDesc"><i class="vocDesc">Rationale:</i> The concepts of a "request" and an "order" are viewed as different, because there is an implication of a mandate associated
                     with order.  In practice, however, this distinction has no general functional value in the inter-operation of health care
                     computing.  "Orders" are commonly refused for a variety of clinical and business reasons, and the notion of a "request" obligates
                     the recipient (the fulfiller) to respond to the sender (the author).  Indeed, in many regions, including Australia and Europe,
                     the common term used is "request."
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="vocDesc">Thus, the concept embodies both notions, as there is no useful distinction to be made.  If a mandate is to be associated with
                     a request, this will be embodied in the "local" business rules applied to the transactions.  Should HL7 desire to provide
                     a distinction between these in the future, the individual concepts could be added as specializations of this concept.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="vocDesc">The critical distinction here, is the difference between this concept and an "intent", of which it is a specialization.  An
                     intent involves decisions by a single party, the author.  A request, however, involves decisions by two parties, the author
                     and the fulfiller, with an obligation on the part of the fulfiller to respond to the request indicating that the fulfiller
                     will indeed fulfill the request.

                     this would be regarded as a marker of a negative outcome or of deterioration towards a negative outcome. Recording a risk
                     indicates that it is seen as more likely to occur in the subject than in a general member of the population but does not mean
                     it is expected to occur.

                     present (e.g. obesity, smoking, etc) should be expressed in event mood. INT (intent) reflects a plan for the future, which
                     is a declaration to do something. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur
                     that may or may not ever happen. GOL (goal) reflects a hope to achieve something. EXPEC (expectation) is the prediction of
                     a positive or negative event. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that
                     may or may not ever happen, and may not be expected to happen.
