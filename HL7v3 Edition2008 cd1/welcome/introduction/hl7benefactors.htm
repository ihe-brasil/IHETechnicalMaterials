  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</h3>
<p>The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is part of the U.S. Department of
  Veteran Affairs (VA). As a major healthcare provider, VHA operates more than
  170 medical centers and 600 clinics and contracts an additional $1B a year
  to outside providers for veteran healthcare. We are directly impacted by numerous
  internal and external factors such as government legislation and directives,
  the healthcare industry, the information technology industry and internal restructuring.
  Like many other organizations the VHA has been charged with reducing costs
  in a way that systematically produces clear, measurable and improved performance
  that translates into improved products and services. Each of these factors
  generates different pressures and makes the interchange of healthcare information
  critical. Additionally, our size and complexity create special technical issues
  for us.</p>
<p>VHA believes a major part of the solution to these challenges is through participation
  in the Health Level Seven organization. We are pleased to be a benefactor member
  and consider the success of HL7 as strategically important to us. VHA intends
  to be an early adopter of the HL7 Version 3 model and is particularly excited
  over the possibilities of XML. We plan to be a major participant in the Government
  Projects SIG and look forward to partnering with other members as we expand
  our internal commercial off-the-shelf portfolio and develop additional provider
  relationships. A goal is to increase our involvement with the HL7 organization
  in the spirit of returning something for the many benefits we accrue.</p>
