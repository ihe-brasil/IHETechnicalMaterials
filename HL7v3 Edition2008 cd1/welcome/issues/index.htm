				<h2 style="background-color:f2eed6;">Update Notifications</h2>
				To keep you continually apprised of any updates or patches to this edition, we have instituted a special list service to which you may subscribe. You can only sign up through this web page by <a href="http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/list_sub.cfm?list=v3ballotupdates">clicking here</a>. This is a closed list so only HL7 staff will be permitted to post messages; this will ensure that the list is used to distribute information about what has been updated, not provide a forum for discussion.  Discussion regarding the ballot publishing may be hosted on the Editors list.<br><br>
