                        <p>The objective of this storyboard is to illustrate the way a patient's pedigree with clinical and genomic data could be represented
                           for risk analysis purposes in the context of breast and ovarian cancers and other diseases. The initial context for this storyboard
                           was set by the BRCA storyboard which is still under development. The UML Activity Diagram below as well as the Presentation
                           section further on are taken from the BRCA storyboard, illustrating the use of family history data in this case.

                              <p>The Family History storyboard and its HL7 Pedigree Model is part of the HL7 Clinical-Genomics SIG effort to design various
                                 higher-level models of using genomic data in healthcare practice, that utilize the basic model of a Genotype (described at
                                 this point as the Clinical Genomics Domain Information Model). The need to represent a patient's pedigree information as associated
                                 with clinical and genomic data was introduced in the BRCA (Breast Cancer) storyboard which is still under development.
                              </p>
                              <p>The BRCA storyboard includes a sample outline for the way the patient's pedigree should look:</p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/FMsampleData.gif" alt="FMsampleData.gif" /><br /><br /><p>Populating the above outline with actual data might result in a spreadsheet found in the following link:</p><a href="graphics/FMsampleDataSheet.gif" target="_blank" style="border:0"><img class="graphic" src="graphics/T-FMsampleDataSheet.gif" alt="T-FMsampleDataSheet.gif" /></a><p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Ms. Eve Everywoman has a family history of breast and ovarian cancer, and she is not of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.</li>
                                 <li>She believes she is at high risk of developing breast cancer.</li>
                                 <li>She goes to see her clinician (Medical oncologist, surgical oncologist , radiation oncologist, primary care provider) who
                                    takes a thorough family history.  This history is recorded in the chart and the electronic medical record.
                                 </li>
                                 <li>The clinician reviews the family history, decides what genetic syndrome her family might have, and categorizes the patient
                                    as to degree of risk (Perhaps high, medium, or low risk).  The clinician thinks the patient is at high risk of having a BRCA1/2
                                    mutation.
                                 </li>
                                 <li>The clinician compares her Family History to tables of risk (Claus, Myriad) and runs computer models (algorithms such as BRCAPRO,
                                    see http://www.isds.duke.edu/~gp/brcapro.html).  This gives a percentage risk of carrying a mutation and/or a risk of developing
                                    breast and/or ovarian cancer.  Her risk of a mutation is 25%, because her father's 4 sisters had ovarian caner.
                                 </li>
                                 <li>The patient is considered to be at high risk of having a mutation, and this information is given to her.</li>
                                 <li>She is referred to a Risk Clinic.</li>
                                 <li>She agrees to go to the Risk Clinic.</li>
                                 <li>Ms Eve Everywoman's Genetic History details are sent to this clinic (the HL7 Interaction <a class="">POCG_IN000001</a> is used), including her Family History, the syndrome suspected and her level of risk.
                                 </li>
                                 <li>The counselor at the risk clinic (Nurse geneticist, genetic counselor, MD, etc.) reviews the family history information collected
                                    by the primary clinician, edits it and adds additional details.

                                 <li>The Counselor reviews the family history, decides what genetic syndrome her family might have, and categorizes the patient
                                    as to degree of risk (Perhaps high, medium, or low risk).  The Counselor thinks the patient is at high risk of having a BRCA1/2
                                    mutation.

                                 <li>The clinician compares the family history to tables of risk (Claus, Myriad) and runs computer models (algorithms such as BRCAPRO).
                                    This gives a percentage risk of carrying a mutation and/or a risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.  Her risk of
                                    a mutation is 25%, because her father's 4 sisters had ovarian caner.

                                 <li>The patient is considered to be at high risk, and she is told she is a candidate for genetic testing.  This includes a thorough
                                    discussion of the pros and cons of testing.  This discussion is recorded in the electronic medical record.

                                    aunt.  The pedigree from the point of view of Ms Jeanne Aunt must have Jeanne Aunt as the Proband (Self) and must show Ms

                        <p><strong>The Clinical Genomics Family History Model</strong></p>
                        <p>Following the above sample of a patient's pedigree as well as the contextual presentation, 
                           	we have developed an HL7 model to allow the representation of such a pedigree
                           	with an unlimited depth of generations. The model addresses the Family History requirements
                           	and represents a patient's pedigree while making use of the Genotype model for genomic
                           	data.     Each family member object is represented in relation to another family member who
                           	'scopes' its role and is designated by a code taken from the HL7 vocabulary "RoleCode", domain ="PersonalRelationshipRoleType".
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>General Notes:  </p>
                        <p>The Family History model is used in a message interaction designed to serve the need of information exchange between two disparate
                           pedigree applications (see section on message interactions). This interaction does not serve other needs like sending genetic
                           lab orders accompanied by family history. For the latter, there is a need to use Lab messages that might use this model as
                           a payload.
                        </p>
                        <p>The model utilizes the GeneticLocus model (the Genotype Topic) in order to
                           	capture genomic data in any resolution needed. For that end, the GeneticLocus model was
                           	packaged as an internal CMET and was also moved to the HL7 Common Domains in the V3 Ballot
                           	Package. It is utilized in this model as one of the choices in the main Clinical Genomics
                           	choice box (see the model walk through below). 
                           	The model suggests the use of the Clinical Statement shared model (under
                           	development in HL7) to represent the clinical data. Meanwhile, it has a generic
                           	ClinicalObservation class to hold common clinical data (e.g., problems, diagnoses,
                           	reactions to drugs, allergies, etc.).      
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Model Walk-Through</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Starting Point - FamilyHistory:</strong></p>
                        <p>The starting point of the model is the FamilyHistory Observation class. This
                           	class has several associations, one of which is subject participation of the Patient role
                           	played by a Person entity. The latter scopes the Relative class which can hold information
                           	about the patient's relatives. This constitutes the backbone of the model. In addition, the
                           	entry point is associated with risk analysis results and with problems that can not be
                           	attributed to specific family members.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Attributes of FamilyHistory:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>id: holds a unique identifier of this family history instance</li>
                           <li>code: the code attribute shall hold a code representing Family History data in general, for example: the LOINC code 10157-6,

                           Provider (the scoping entity of the Patient role). Person is the player entity of Patient and holds general information about
                           the person like gender, birth time, deceased indication, etc.

                           	statements as well as genomic data represented by the GeneticLocus model. Note that this

                              <p>The ClinicalObservation class represents any clinical data that
                                 			is part of the Person clinical history. Currently, the class has the classCode of 'OBS'
                                 			which means that it is capable of representing only observations. However, the full
                                 			expression of a clinical statement will be available when this single class will be
                                 			replaced by the HL7 Clinical Statement model (under development). The Clinical Statement
                                 			model will provide the 'grammar' of how various discrete acts (observations, procedures,
                                 			substance administrations, etc.) are associated to a meaningful clinical statement.
                                 			Nevertheless, in the January 2007 ballot we added a recursive ActRelationship (sourceOf) to the clinical observation to
                                 address use cases where a richer clinical statement is need, as introduced to us by early adopters of the model. The addition
                                 of this association is in consistent with the Clinical Statement model, so that when eventually this single observation is
                                 replaced with the Clinical Statement model or a derivative of it, this current addition is in consistent with it and will
                                 not require substantive changes to the family history implementations.

                           	(see further explanation in the "Person and Relative" bullet below). The cardinality of
                           	this association is 0..* which allows for the representation of any number of relatives who
                           	all relate to the Person who scopes the role.     
                           	The Relative class has a classCode = "PRS", defined as "links two people in a
                           	personal relationship... the character of the relationship must be defined by a
                           	PersonalRelationshipRoleType code..." The latter code is defined by the Relative.code
                           	attribute whose value set is drawn from the domain "PersonalRelationshipRoleType".
                           	Appendix E includes a table that shows the codes of this domain. Using values from this
                           	domain it is possible to designate the relation to the patient or to the patient's family
                           	member. Thus, in this model it is possible to use, for example, the code GRMTH
                           	(grandmother) for Relative associated directly to the patient, or use the code NMTH
                           	(mother) for Relative associated to the mother of the patient. This makes the model more
                           	flexible.  
                        </p>
                        <p>The basis of this part of the model is in the RIM definition of family member relationships which are based on the relationship
                           between a scoping entity and a role. For example, the code CHILD is defines as "The player of the role is a child of the scoping
                           entity", and the same goes for any type of family relationship. Note that this is valid not only to the relationship between
                           the patient and a relative directly associated with the patient, rather this is true for any relationship between family members
                           on this pedigree, for example, between the patient's mother  (the scoper) and her father (the role).

                              <p>This choice box is associated with the Relative class and holds</p>
                              <p>two classes concerned with estimated ages of the subject as follows:</p>
                              <ul>

                                    <p>The DeceasedEstimatedAge class is used to hold
                                       					the estimated age when the subject died. It is used due to a lack of age attribute in all
                                       					HL7 classes. We have proposed to RIM harmonization the addition of age attribute to hold
                                       					the deceased age as well as the subject age at the time a diagnosis was made (see above in
                                       					the DataEstimatedAge class description), but were asked to try and model this piece of
                                       					information using associated observations like this class.

                                    <p><strong>LivingEstimatedAge</strong></p>
                                    <p>The LivingEstimatedAge class is used to hold the
                                       					estimated age of a living relative whose birth date is unknown. 
                                    </p>

                                 <li>For a living subject, the code shall represent semantics similar to the LOINC code "21611-9" that represents the concept of
                                    an estimated age (as opposed to precise age). For a deceased subject, the code shall represent semantics similar to the LOINC
                                    code 39016-1 (AGE AT DEATH). 
                                 </li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>subjectOf Shadow</strong></p>
                        <p>This class is a shadow of the subjectOf2 class associated with Patient and thus
                           	also includes all its associated classes. This means that the same clinical and genomic
                           	data structures attached to the patient could be optionally attached to any of his/her
                           	relatives represented by the Relative class. It could be that the clinical data of any of
                           	the persons involved in this pedigree model exist elsewhere (in the same message or
                           	document, or in the person medical records). In this case it is possible to point to that
                           	data by including stub classes which only hold ids of the actual data, thus enabling
                           	applications to get the information if needed.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Person and Relative</strong></p>
                        <p>The Person class allows the representation of personal information like gender
                           	and birth time of each of the patient's relatives. It is also linked back to the Relative
                           	class, an association which enables a recursive traversal a pedigree at any level of depth
                           	in a pure XML hierarchical fashion (i.e., only by nesting elements). Note that in each new
                           	traversal of this recursive association, the scoping Person represents another family
                           	member, and consequently the Relative class relates to this family member and not directly
                           	to the patient. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In general, the issue of recursion and XML hierarchy relate to the
                           	representation of pedigree data which is hierarchical by nature but could be represented in
                           	various ways using XML nesting elements on the one hand or mother and father ids for each
                           	relative thus constituting the hierarchy via links and pointers and not via nesting
                           	elements. The latter format also allows the flat outline of the pedigree. These issues are
                           	discussed in more detail in the documentation available from the HL7 Clinical Genomics SIG
                           	page in the HL7 site. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Relative - Mother and Father Identifiers</strong></p>
                        <p>In a flat XML representation of a pedigree it is often required to maintain
                           	mother and father ids for each relative, in order to allow the family history application
                           	to reconstruct the pedigree. These ids should be placed in the id attribute of the Person
                           	class. That class should be populated for each parent if available. The first XML sample in
                           	appendix D shows a flat representation of a pedigree with the ids populated in the Person
                           	class (XML element is relationshipHolder.id).
                        </p>
                        <p>It is required to use globally unique ids as mandated from the use of the II data type for
                           	the id attribute. Regarding the generation of thses ids, there can be two situations: (1)
                           	The application generating the pedigree has a 'root' OID dedicated to this purpose and it
                           	extends it for each pedigree it creates. Then, it generates arbitrary unique ids for each
                           	relative who doesn't have a globally unique id and places it in the extension component.
                           	The concatenation of the pedigree root and relative extension creates a globally unique id
                           	for the person; (2) The application knows a globally unique id of a relative and uses it.
                           	Note that in a certain pedigree there can be a mixture of the two situations.

                        </table>A number of pedigree applications are in use by healthcare professionals (e.g., CAGENE) as well as by patients (e.g., the
                        US Surgeon General Family History Program), which each have their own internal proprietary format of representing data for
                        pedigree drawing and maintenance of family history information. We envision that any pedigree application will be able to
                        send and receive an individual's family history information using this HL7 specification, either electronically or through
                        import/export routines that will be developed for each Pedigree application. Note that this is a general purpose information
                        exchange, i.e., it's not designed to serve use cases such as lab orders or specific patient care scenarios.  For example,
                        the interaction can serve the following short storyboard (derived from the "Family History" storyboard presented in the Clinical
                        Genomics domain):
                        
                        Ms. Martha Francis is 48 years old.  Her mother had ovarian cancer and was found to have a deleterious BRCA1 mutation.  She
                        has two sisters, a husband and a daughter.  She is not of Ashkenazi Jewish descent
                        
                        She makes an appointment at a Risk Clinic.  The Clinic instructs the patient to use the Surgeon General's Family History Tool
                        to prepare for the visit.  She downloads the Surgeon General's Family History Tool onto her computer at home, and enters her
                        family history.
                        
                        She then exports the data as an HL7 MESSAGE, places it on Portable Media (CD, Flash drive) and brings it to her Risk Clinic
                        appointment.
                        
                        The counselor at the risk clinic (Nurse geneticist, Nurse Practitioner, Genetic Counselor, MD, etc.) imports the HL7 MESSAGE
                        into CAGENE, a pedigree drawing program that runs risk models.  The counselor edits the data after confirming and clarifying
                        various issues with the patient, and adds additional information that had not been entered at home.
                        
                        The patient is considered to be at high risk, and she is told she is a candidate for genetic testing.  This includes a thorough
                        discussion of the pros and cons of testing.  The patient decides not to have testing, and leaves.
