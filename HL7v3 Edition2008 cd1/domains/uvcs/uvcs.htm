                     since January 2004 as part of a joint initiative of the following Technical Committees: Orders and Observations; Patient Care;
                     and Structured Documents. The version of the model in this ballot (v1.0.0.) includes the changes agreed up to CSCR-068 and

                        <p><strong>Scope of Clinical Statement Pattern Domain</strong></p>
                        <p>The model described in this document is a 'pattern' designed to be used within multiple HL7 Version 3 domain models. This
                           pattern is intended to facilitate the consistent design of communications that convey clinical information to meet specific
                           use cases. In most cases the pattern will be refined for use within the model using the clinical statement. There are two
                           CMETs based on the pattern  - COCT_MT530000 A_SupportingClinicalStatement universal and COCT_MT530004 A_SupportingClinicalStatement
                           minimal.  
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not intended that the 'pattern' itself is ever used in a communication, accordingly the information in this document
                           is necessarily at a high level with a minimum of constraints applied.  The pattern does not represent a Record Architecture
                           or a physical structure for storing data on an EHR database, although it does cover many of the types of clinical information
                           that should be part of an Electronic Health Record. The Clinical Statement ballot will include ballot topics (over time -
                           common patterns such as Lab, Allergy, etc.) where those topics will be written such that they are as much as possible isomorphic
                           with the domain models to which they correspond.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Clinical Statement model is deliberately broad and encompassing. As a result, it would be possible to represent a particular
                           statement in more than one way. The primary objective of the Clinical Statement topics (see section 2 Clinical Statement Topics)
                           is to contrain the Clinical Statement model when used to communicate certain types of information in an effort to enhance
                           interoperability and shareable semantics. The process for developing these constraints is described in section 2.4 Development
                           of Clinical Statement Topics. The result of the constraint process is to create a Clinical Statement pattern that is isomorphic
                           with an HL7 committee's primary domain model.
                        </p>
                        <p>The formal definition of a clinical statement for the care of patients is:</p>
                        <p>"An expression of a discrete item of clinical (or clinically related) information that is recorded because of its relevance
                           to the care of a patient.  Clinical information can be expressed with different levels of granularity and therefore the extent
                           and detail conveyed in a single statement may vary.  To be regarded as a clinical statement, a concept must be associated
                           with a patient in a manner which makes clear:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                           <li>
                              <p>Its temporal context</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Its relationship to the patient</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>In the case of an observation, its mood and presence, absence or value</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>In the case of a procedure, its mood and status</p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This clarity may be achieved by: </p>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Background sources</strong></p>
                        <p>This Clinical Statement pattern is informed by many individuals from many countries, including but not limited to representatives
                           from the UK National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) and the HL7 Structured Documents Technical Committee. The
                           Clinical Statement Task Force acknowledges and wishes to thank all these individuals and organizations for their valuable
                           contributions. This standard is not intended, however, to be a derivative of any of these sources and these sources should
                           not be used to interpret any semantics communicated within this document.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Use of the model</strong></p>
                        <p>The Clinical Statement pattern represents a standard, high-level structure for the inclusion of clinical information in communications
                           intended to support specific business functions.  Although not capable of being implemented 'as is', the Clinical Statement
                           pattern can be constrained to meet the requirements of many specific communications regarding clinical information.  The process
                           of modification will involve either pattern constraint or extension (or sometimes both) in order to achieve the needs of a
                           particular domain. There are two CMETs based on the pattern:

                                       use to a specific structure (in that case, the constrained version of the class may no longer be assumed to be present in
                                       the generalized Clinical Statement Choice Box)
                                    </p>
                                 </li>

                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Pattern Use</strong></p>
                        <p>This pattern is to be referenced by an Act external to the Clinical Statement pattern model.   Often, this external Act provides
                           the 'Entry point' to a communication specification and represents the context in which the clinical statement information
                           is being sent. For example, the information regarding who is sending this information is found in an Act external to the Clinical
                           Statement pattern. The Care Provision Act in the Care Provision Domain is an example of an Act external to the pattern.

                        <p><strong>1.2.1   Model Overview</strong></p>
                        <p>The model can be divided into 4 related parts:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Clinical Statement Act Choice Box</li>
                           <li>Relationships between Clinical Statements</li>
                           <li>Participations surrounding the Acts</li>
                           <li>Acts and relationships outside the Choice Box</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each of these parts is described below in sections 1.2.3 - 1.2.6.</p>
                        <p><strong>1.2.2     Attributes of Clinical Statements</strong></p>
                        <p>In general, the use of attributes within classes representing Clinical Statements follows the standard HL7 v3 rules.  </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.2.1     moodCode</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Following the HL7 v3 approach to modeling, most of the classes within the Clinical Statement can be assigned a moodCode that
                           determines whether it is reporting an actual event or expressing a request, proposal, promise, appointment or goal.  The only
                           exception is Organizer.moodCode, which always has a value of 'EVN'. The allowed values for this attribute in most Clinical
                           Statement classes have been specified using an x_domain. Where a TC or Realm implementation etc. uses a constrained version
                           of this model, the value set for the constrained model may be restricted to a sub-set of one or more of the values allowed.
                        </p>
                        <p>The use of moodCode overlaps with SNOMED CT context attributes and the SNOMED CT concept identifiers and expressions used
                           in the code attribute shall not contradict the moodCode. The Terminfo project provides guidance on the binding between the
                           moodCode and the SNOMED CT context model for the different classes in the Clinical Statement pattern.
                        </p>
                        <p>NOTE: [Derived from the draft Vocabulary TC document "Domain and Value Set Definitions and Binding.] The name X-domain is
                           a misnomer. A more proper name would be "X-Value Sets", since they are really HL7 defined value sets. As time permits, all
                           X-domains will be replaced by Value Sets. When this occurs the current x_domains in the RIM and in the Clinical Statement
                           pattern will be replaced by value sets containing the same values. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.2.2     id</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Each instance of a Clinical Statement may be identified by means of an id using any of the HL7's II data types which currently
                           includes GUID/UUID, OID, or RUID in the root plus a potential extension. Any of these provides a unique identification, depending
                           on the level of coupling between the communicating systems, which in turn uniquely identifies the specific Clinical Statement.
                           If precisely the same information (statement and context) is required to be referenced either in the same communication instance
                           or in another communication instance, then the same identifier value shall be used in an ActReference to reference the original
                           Clinical Statement.
                        </p>
                        <p>Conversely, if all of the attributes and context of a Clinical Statement class are not identical, then it is a different Clinical
                           Statement and a new unique identifier shall be assigned.  This means:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              <p>a subset of a Clinical Statement is a different Clinical Statement, requiring a different identifier </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>an Organizer where one of the 'contained' statements is modified is a new statement requiring a new identifier. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The clinical statement 'pattern' allows Clinical Statements to have multiple identifiers.  This allows Clinical Statements
                           to be identified by a human readable identifier in addition to the unique identifier and will always be represented by an
                           OID and code value.  The use of these identifiers could include identifiers such as departmental order number, episode number
                           etc. where required by specific communication use cases.
                        </p>
                        <p>NOTE: Modeling and Methodology (MnM) are currently undertaking work to allow identifiers to be classified based on their role
                           in the life cycle and the local management practices for Clinical Statements. When this work is complete, it will be reflected
                           in the definitions for this attribute.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.2.3     code</em></strong></p>
                        <p>The code attribute is used to identify the nature of the information conveyed by an instance of a Clinical Statement Act.
                           Code may be optional in some specifications. The cardinality and conformance of the code attribute in the Observation is act
                           is 1..1 required. While the attribute must be present in all Observation instances it is permissible to send an exceptional
                           value from the NullFlavor vocabulary domain as a legal value. The HL7 v3 data type of the code attribute is CD (Concept Descriptor).
                           The CD data type allows the inclusion of:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              <p>The text assigned to the code by the coding scheme (displayText) and the text on which the encoding was based (originalText)</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Qualifiers of the type used in SNOMED CT (including context attributes) to refine the meaning of the primary code</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Each qualifier is a name + value pair with the name expressed as a code and the value expressed as another instance of the
                                       CD data type (allowing nested qualifiers where needed).
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Translations to allow the representation of the concept in the coding scheme in which it originated as well as translated
                                 into other preferred terminologies.
                              </p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Note that the original code is expressed at the outer level with the required code (if different) expressed as a translation
                                       within this.  The ability to recognize the original code is important to enable future enhanced translations based on improved
                                       mappings.  Thus, if the data was originally encoded in a different coding system the original code should be included with
                                       the translation element containing the SNOMED CT representation.
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The CD data type supports the use of pre and post-coordination of vocabulary expressions and this model places no restrictions
                           on how these expressions are represented other than the constraints imposed by the respective terminologies.  
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.2.4     value</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Observation.value is information that is assigned or determined by the observation action. </p>
                        <p>There is still some debate for many observation events, in determining how to populate Observation.code and Observation.value.
                           While this is typically straight-forward for laboratory observations, it can get blurry for other types of observations, such
                           as findings and disorders, family history observations, etc. The HL7 Terminfo project has defined the principles for different
                           patterns of the use for these two attributes where the clinical terminology used in the code attribute is SNOMED Clinical
                           Terms. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The data type of the Observation.value attribute varies and where the expression in Observation.code requires a value, the
                           subset of allowed data types is constrained by the code. Where the PQ data type is used then the UCUM codes should be used
                           to represent the units of the measurement.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.2.5     priorityCode</em></strong></p>
                        <p>The Act.priorityCode is defined by HL7 as: "A code or set of codes (e.g., for routine, emergency,) specifying the urgency
                           under which the Act happened, can happen, is happening, is intended to happen, or is requested/demanded to happen".
                        </p>
                        <p>The priorityCode attribute has a potential overlap with some vocabularies.   This potential conflict is resolved as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              <p>priorityCode should be used to indicate the priority as it relates to workflow management. It is also used to indicate priority
                                 assigned by the originator of a request or result or to indicate the priority with which the communication recipient should
                                 respond to the information in the Act.  For example, the request for a procedure should be treated as 'urgent'.  
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Where the vocabulary used in the message has a priority attribute, then this should be used in coded expressions where the
                                 priority significantly alters the Act.code, or in the case of an Observation, the Observation.value attribute. For example,
                                 the concept 'an Emergency appendectomy' should be expressed totally within vocabulary expression used in Procedure.code.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong><em>1.2.2.6     Act.code dependent attributes in the Clinical Statement model</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Some coded attributes included in the HL7 v3 RIM are deliberately made optional in Act classes in this model because they
                           represent qualifications that might be more appropriately handled within the terminology model (e.g.  using SNOMED CT qualifiers
                           within the code attribute where necessary).  These include:

                        <p>The rationale for considering these attributes optional is that flexibility is required by realms in order to be able to implement
                           the vocabularies of choice without ambiguities related to whether a particular concept is included in an Act.code expression
                           or included in another Act Class attribute value. The Terminfo project provides guidance on how these attributes should be
                           used in models and message instances where the code system used is SNOMED CT.

                           statements. Much research has demonstrated that headings are used differently by different professional groups and specialties,
                           and that headings are not used consistently enough to support safe automatic processing of the EHR. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The value for Act.ClassCode may be taken from the ActClassContainer vocabulary domain. Several specific types of collection
                           are recognized (folder, composition, topic, category, cluster and battery), although individual communications will restrict
                           the types that may be used for individual communication use cases.
                        </p>
                        <p>NOTE: The ActClassContainer title was changed to ActClassRecordOrganizer at the July 2007 harmonization meeting. The Entry
                           code was changed to Grouper and the Organizer was changed to Container. When this change is added to the RIM the messaging
                           tools and the vocabulary for this class will be changed to ActClassRecordOrganizer.
                        </p>
                        <p>An Organizer typically can be assigned a SNOMED CT concept identifier appropriate to its type (for example a category might
                           be identified as 'investigations' and a battery might be identified as 'Full blood count'). However, any kind of concept identifier
                           can be used, such as in the case of the HL7 CDA R2 Implementation Guides where LOINC is frequently employed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The Organizer may be used to harmonize hierarchical RECORD_COMPONENTs within and ENTRY object under either the CEN/ISO 13606
                           or openEHR standard with a Clinical Statement. 
                        </p>
                        <p>NOTE: Clinical Statement ActChoice Acts such as Observation can also contain other ActChoice Acts by traversing the sourceOf2
                           class. There is no requirement that the Organizer statement be used in order to group clinical statements. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The value sets for Organizer.moodCode (CNE) is fixed to EVN (Event). </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.3.7     Act Class</em></strong></p>
                        <p>The Act (ACT) choice is a derivative of the RIM Act class, to be used when the other more specific classes are not appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Attributes of the Act Class include:</p>
                        <p>Act.negationInd: when set to "true", is a positive assertion that the descriptive attributes of the Act as a whole are negated.
                           The inert properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, and the participations are not negated. These inert properties always have
                           the same meaning: i.e., the author remains the author of the negative Act. An act statement with negationInd is still a statement
                           about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated "finding of wheezing on July 1" means that the author
                           positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the
                           same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The value for Act.moodCode (CNE) may be taken from the x_ClinicalStatementActMood. See the detailed description of moodCode
                           below for more details on the use of x_domains in this model.

                        <p>NOTE: This vocabulary "domain" does not contain the value Risk (RSK). A harmonization proposal requesting this addition will
                           be submitted to the November 2007 harmonization meeting.

                        <p><strong>1.2.4     Relationships between Clinical Statements</strong></p>
                        <p>The model provides three mechanisms that allow Clinical Statements to be linked by the Act Relationship Class:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Containment</li>
                           <li>Direct relationship</li>
                           <li>Reference</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These links may be achieved by one of three act relationships in the pattern described below:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>component</li>
                           <li>sourceOf2/targetOf</li>
                           <li>sourceOf1</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are all refinements of the same general structure and share the following facilities:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>inversionInd; when 'true' reverses the direction of the relationship e.g. 'Cause of' becomes 'Caused by' (see Context and
                              Inheritance below for how this works with Context Inheritance)
                           </li>
                           <li>negationInd; when 'true' allows the sender to specifically state that the relationship does not apply e.g.. An observation
                              was not caused by a medication
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is some overlap in the potential use of these three relationship mechanisms that shall be resolved as follows:</p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.4.1     Containment</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Grouping of classes of clinical data is achieved using collector classes such as the Organizer Class and ConditionNode Class
                           (a specialization of the Observation class code) associated with a 'Component' Act Relationship that supports recursion of
                           the Clinical Statement structure.  
                        </p>
                        <p>Grouping can be used for many purposes, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Relating statements.  For example, an Antenatal exam may comprise individual observations of maternal weight, maternal BP,
                              fetal size, fetal heart rate etc.
                           </li>
                           <li>Linking statements relating to a specific 'Problem' in the case of Condition Node</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Organizer: The type of grouping permitted is restricted by the vocabulary used in the Organizer.code attribute. Specific vocabulary
                           constraints will be applied in individual communication designs based on the communication requirement that is being addressed.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.4.2     Direct relationship</em></strong></p>
                        <p>This linkage type is supported by the recursion on the Clinical Statement, with ActRelationship.typeCode specifying the nature
                           of the link between the statements.  It is used to include a Clinical Statement in a communication that relates to another
                           included Clinical Statement but is not directly pertinent to the Focal Act, source Act or purpose of the communication.
                        </p>
                        <p>An example would be if a previous condition explains an observation made during an encounter.  In this case the previous condition
                           is only being included in the communication to explain the observation and not because it was identified during the encounter.
                        </p>
                        <p>Where the supporting Clinical Statement is already available from a previous communication, the link by reference approach
                           may be used to convey this type of linkage. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.4.3     Reference</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Linking Clinical Statements by reference is supported by the sourceOf1 Act Relationship between the Clinical Statement and
                           	ActReference, again with typeCode specifying the nature of the link.  There are three cases for its use:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              <p>To assert a link to a Clinical Statement that is already in the communication instance for another purpose, thus 	avoiding
                                 unnecessary duplication
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>To assert a link to a Clinical Statement that is directly related to the purpose of the communication but has been sent as
                                 part of a prior notification
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>To link to a Clinical Statement that is already available as a result of an unrelated communication.</p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The ActReference.classCode and ActReference.moodCode shall take the values of the target Act and ActReference.id is the unique
                           identifier of the target Clinical Statement. 
                        </p>
                        <p>NOTE: The current methodology for ActReference is not ideal, since only the class name itself helps to know that this construct
                           actually is an act reference and not just an act. RIM class names are not intended to be semantic markers. MnM are working
                           to resolve this and are defining a way of unambiguously knowing that this is a reference. It is suggested that implementers
                           refer to current MnM guidance, pre-adopting if necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternatively, in many contexts, given the small nature of the act reference, just ClassCode and MoodCode and Id, will serve
                           to identify it - though this is a workaround at best.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.4.4     component</em></strong></p>
                        <p>The component relationship is used to link the organizer class to one or more ActChoice Acts. The component.typeCode value
                           is fixed to COMP (is component of) and is used to show that the target is a component of the source Organizer act (for instance
                           "hemoglobin measurement" is a component of a "complete blood count"). The source Organizer can contain other Organizers and/or
                           other clinical statements, by traversing the component relationship.
                        </p><strong><em>     1.2.4.5     sourceOf2/targetOf</em></strong><p>Clinical Statement has identified and modelled various link scenarios. These scenarios enable ActChoice Acts to be semantically
                           linked to Acts that exist within the same document or message
                        </p>
                        <p>NOTE: The Clinical Statement model permits any ActChoice Act to relate to any ActChoice Act using any of the following relationship
                           types. In many cases, this would result in nonsensical relationships. The following table is a guideline for reasonable relationships
                           between Clinical Statement Acts and is not a conformance constraint.

                        <p>The sourceOf2.inversionInd can be set to "true" to indicate that the relationship should be interpreted as if the roles of

                           pain". Inverted, this would have "chest pain" as the source and "treadmill test" as the target: "chest pain" RSON (inverted)
                           "treadmill test". Inversion can be useful when the current context is describing the target of an act relationship that needs

                           in the same document keeps clear the fact that the 	referenced object retains its original context.

                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.4.7     Context and Inheritance</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Although potentially complex, context inheritance provides an essential facility that:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              <p>removes the need to explicitly state the full context of every Clinical Statement as in the general case this can be inherited
                                 from the source statement; and
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>provides a mechanism that allows specific items of context to be overridden when appropriate.  For instance the 'author' of
                                 a result for a battery is assumed to be the author for all the components but each test within the battery could be performed
                                 by a different person or device.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Following the HL7 v3 conventions the source class (the class at the 'blunt' end of the SourceOf arrow) always specifies the
                           context  in which the SourceOf was asserted.  Thus this source class indicates the attribution (time, author, etc.) of the
                           linkage. The semantic direction of the relationship type (as expressed by SourceOf.typeCode) can be reversed using the inversionInd.
                           As this does not reverse the owning context it allows the full range of directional relationships to be expressed from the
                           context of either of the related classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>The seperatableInd in an Act Relationship indicates whether the author is willing to attest to the content of the source Act
                           if it is separated from the target Act.  A value of 'false' indicates that they intend that the two acts are not separated
                           for interpretation. This clearly cannot be enforced, but is intended as a warning to the recipient of the author's intent.
                           The value of the seperatableInd is not propagated beyond the target Act, regardless of other context inheritance.
                        </p>
                        <p>Unless an Act Relationship specifically indicates to the contrary (a value of 'true' in the contextConductionInd), context
                           is not inherited from source to  target.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the contextConductionInd in an Act Relationship is set to 'false' then none of the context of the source Act is inherited
                           by the target Act.  However, when set to 'true', all of the context is inherited, except for Participations in the source
                           Act where the contextControlCode is set to a 'non-propagating' value.  Where a specific Participation is included for an Act,
                           this overrides any inherited Participation of the same type unless the contextControlCode is set to an 'additive' value when
                           the specific Participation is in  addition to the inherited value (i.e. there are multiple Participations of the same type).
                           Context inherited in this way is limited to Participations in an Act.  For a full discussion of propagation and its representation,
                           refer to the RIM section of the HL7 Version 3 Standard.

                        </p><em><strong><em>     1.2.5.1     subject</em></strong></em><p>The patient is considered to be the Subject of each Clinical Statement in the communication unless it is explicitly indicated
                           that this is not the case for the specified statement(s). This can be indicated in one of the following ways:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The Clinical Statement has a subject participation that provides details of the person to whom the statement relates </li>

                        <p>The record target is the entity for which the Care Provision is being recorded, like the details of the baby go in the record
                           of the mother. There is normally only one record target for a Clinical Statement. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.5.3     author</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Represents the humans and/or machines that authored the statements. This may be an assigned person or organization (R_AssignedEntity)
                           such as a healthcare provider, a related party such as a family member or court, or the patient (R_Patient) themselves. The
                           author participant can be ascribed to a Clinical Statement where it overrides the value(s) propagated from the focal or source
                           act and propagates to nested Acts.

                           entity. The manufactured material in the R_Medication CMET or the Material class, identifies the drug that is consumed in
                           the substance administration. The Material entity is used to identify non-drug administered substances such as vaccines and
                           blood products. 
                        </p>

                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.5.5     informant</em></strong></p>
                        <p>An informant (or source of information) is a person that provides relevant information, such as the parent of a comatose patient
                           who describes the patient's behavior prior to the onset of coma. This may be an assigned person or organization (R_AssignedEntity)
                           such as a healthcare provider, a related party such as a family member or court, or the patient (R_Patient) themselves. The
                           RelatedEntity role is used to represent an informant without a role.id (e.g. a parent or guy on the street). The informant
                           in this case bears some formal or personal relationship to the patient. RelatedEntity.code can be used to specify the nature
                           of the relationship. The R_AssignedEntity role is used for an identified informant, and is scoped by an Organization. The
                           informant participant, can be ascribed to a Clinical Statement where it overrides the value(s) propagated from the focal or
                           source Act and propagates to nested Acts.

                        <p>The performer is a person who carries out or will carry out a particular act. The performer need not be the principal responsible
                           participant, e.g. a surgery resident operating under supervision of attending surgeon is a performer. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>     1.2.5.7     product</em></strong></p>
                        <p>The dispensed product associates the Supply act to a ManufacturedProduct sold. This may be a LabeledDrug entity or a Material.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><em><strong>1.2.5.8     location</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Describes the location that the Clinical Statement took place or is intended to take place. It uses the ServiceDeliveryLocation
                           role that may optionally use the Place or Organization entities to describe the particular location of the Clinical Statement.
                        </p><strong>1.2.6     Acts and relationships outside the Choice Box</strong><p><strong><em>     1.2.6.1     ControlActEvent</em></strong></p>
                        <p>A Clinical Statement can be associated with the Control Act in the Clinical Statement pattern. Each message has a Control
                           Act wrapper to represent the trigger event to which this message relates. The contents, participations and semantics of the
                           Trigger Event Control act are conducted to each class in the message including each Clinical Statement. In some circumstances,
                           mostly for messaging in transactional domains such as Laboratory and Pharmacy, it may be necessary to associate one or more
                           Clinical Statements to an additional control act. The ControlActEvent has been placed in the Clinical Statement pattern so
                           that those transactional domains that would like to be compliant with the clinical statement may use it in their models and
                           remain Clinical Statement compliant.
                        </p>
                        <p>In non-transactional messages it would be conceivable to use the control act to represent version history and to indicate
                           that the Clinical Statements were subject to trigger events that differ from that in the Control Act wrapper. At present there
                           are a number of areas where the V3 methodology does not support the use of control acts in non-transactional domains. It is
                           advised that the control act is not included in messages derived from the Clinical Statement pattern in non-transactional
                           domains.
                        </p><em><strong>     1.2.6.2     referenceRange</strong></em><p>The referenceRange relationship (described above, see Observation), has a source of Observation, and a target that is another
                           Clinical Statement.

                        <p>The precondition class, derived from the ActRelationship class, is used along with the Criterion class to express a condition
                           that must hold true before some other activity occurs.
