            <p><strong>2.1 Scope of Clinical Statement Topics</strong></p>
            <p>The Clinical Statement model is deliberately broad and encompassing. As a result, it can be possible to represent a particular
               statement in more than one way. The primary objective of the Clinical Statement topics that follow are to constrain the Clinical
               Statement model when used to communicate certain types of information in an effort to enhance interoperability and shareable
               semantics.
            </p>
            <p>See section 2.4 below for notes on the process for developing Clinical Statement topics.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2 Medication Events Topic</strong></p>
            <p><strong>2.2.1 Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>This topic constrains the Clinical Statement model for communicating medication-related events such as substance administrations
               and filling prescriptions. Medication events can be used to define a patient's current medications and pertinent medication
               history. Coupled with supply acts, medication events can convey a patient's prescription history, and can enable the determination
               of the source of a medication list (e.g. from a pharmacy system vs. from the patient).
            </p>
            <p>The template identifier for this pattern: root ="2.16.840.1.113883.10", extension="medication events". </p>
            <p>The overseeing HL7 Committee for this topic: Pharmacy.</p>
            <p>The following figure shows a subset of the Clinical Statement model containing those classes being constrained or referred
               to in the conformance statements that follow. It should be noted that the entire Clinical Statement model is available for
               use, and that the model components not shown can be used without any additional constraints.

            <p><strong>2.3.1 Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>This topic constrains the Clinical Statement model for communicating the results of observations generated by laboratories,
               imaging procedures, and other procedures. The scope includes hematology, chemistry, serology, virology, toxicology, microbiology,
               plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, cardiac echo, nuclear medicine, pathology, and procedure observations.
            </p>
            <p>Lab results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology,
               histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens
               obtained from the patient, submitted to the lab. Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output
               of an imaging procedure, such as where a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction based on the review of
               a cardiac echo.
            </p>
            <p>Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician wanting to provide more granular information about component observations
               made during the performance of a procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during
               a colonoscopy.

                  include the Clinical Genomic's model of Family History, Pharmacy's model of Medications, Patient Care's model of Allergies,
                  etc.

               <li>Work with the HL7 Committee overseeing the identified domain to build an isomorphic model as a set of constraints against
                  the Clinical Statement model. For instance, if a domain model represents a lab battery as a "BATTERY" clone linked to an "OBSERVATION
                  COMPONENT" clone via an ActRelationship with typeCode of "COMP", the corresponding constraint on the Clinical Statement model
                  might be something like: "A lab battery shall be represented as an Organizer. Components of the lab battery shall be represented
                  as nested Observations, linked by an actRelationship.typeCode of COMP".
               </li>
               <li>Work with the HL7 Committee overseeing the identified domain to maintain and extend the Clinical Statement topic as the domain's
                  model changes and evolves over time.
               </li>
               <li>New requirements for topics shall go back to the HL7 Committee overseeing the identified domain. A topic should not introduce
                  constraints that potentially conflict with an evolving HL7 Committee domain model. For instance, if there are requests to
                  develop a constraint on the Clinical Statement model for the representation of microbiology results, step one is to work with
                  the Lab committee to flesh out the details of the model. 
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each Clinical Statement topic is organized as follows:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Each topic has a narrative description defining the scope and use case.</li>
               <li>Each topic has an associated Figure, showing a subset of the Clinical Statement model being constrained. It should be noted
                  that the entire Clinical Statement model is available for use, and that the topics are only focusing on constraints. Thus,
                  Clinical Statement classes not shown in the associated Figure can be used without any additional constraints.
               </li>
               <li>Each topic has a set of constraints, expressed using conformance verbs (e.g. "shall", "should", "may"). </li>
               <li>Each topic has a template identifier, which can be used to populate the InfrastructureRoot.templateId attribute of an instance.
                  An instance that thus populates the templateId attribute is claiming conformance to the corresponding topic.
               </li>
               <li>Each topic has an overseeing HL7 Committee. </li>
            </ul>
