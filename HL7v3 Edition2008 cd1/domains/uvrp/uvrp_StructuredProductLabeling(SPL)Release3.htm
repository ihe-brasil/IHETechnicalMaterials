               <div class="body">
                  <p>This is the third release of the Structured Product Labeling standard (SPL R3). SPL release 3 is a minor maintenance update
                     to the SPL release 2 content, subsequent to nation-wide implementation in the United States. Only very few substantive items
                     have changed; and the change is being documented in this introduction.
                  </p>
                  <p>While only minor modifications are proposed to the content of SPL, the editorial form of the specification has changed significantly.
                     The first two releases of SPL were specified in a word processor document and not in the more rigorous structure in which
                     all HL7 v3 standards are to be defined and published. For the first time now, the SPL standard is fully integrated into the
                     electronic HL7 publishing framework.
                  </p>
                  <p>SPL R2 was discussed as consisting of 2 parts, sometimes confusingly referred to as "SPL 2a" and "SPL 2b". This release of
                     SPL merges these parts together into one. Structurally, SPL consists of 3 parts: (1) document data structures, (2) data structures
                     describing the medicine, and (3) data structures describing the clinical use of the medicine, and connected through the highlight
                     excerpt.
                     In anticipation of further consolidation of the specification into the HL7 publishing framework, a lot of material has also
                     been removed from this word-processor document. This removed material falls in three categories:
                  </p>Text which is mostly tutorial or introductory to HL7 v3 in general, teaching about general approaches and mechanisms of HL7
                  v3, RIM and Data Types. It is assumed that such material is repetitive and at the risk of being inconsistent with the overall
                  HL7 framework.Design rationales of SPL, hopes for its use, and visions for its future development. This text has been removed because it
                  tends to be in the way of stating clearly what an implementer must do and how one should interpret an SPL document. An attempt
                  was made to faithfully retain all text which actually specifies either actionable requirements or rules of interpretation.
                  Each of these points was stated only once and repetitions merged. Some general requirements statements were moved into the
                  main body of the SPL specification, which is no longer this document. The fate of each section of the previous SPL release
                  is documented in the following text under the respective major heading.Examples and code list appendices. The entire appendix apparatus of prior SPL releases was removed. This material was non-normative
                  to begin with, and due to changes in and outside SPL proper has become possibly inconsistent. Vocabulary sets have been extended
                  and many more examples exist from real SPL implementations today (See the DailyMed web site, where SPL content for all of
                  U.S. FDA approved drugs is being published [http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov]).

               <div class="header"><span class="icon"> </span><span class="number">3.2 </span><span class="title"><a>What is SPL?</a></span></div>
               <div class="body">
                  <p>The Structured Product Labeling (SPL) specification is a document markup standard that specifies the structure and semantics
                     of the content of authorized published information that accompanies any medicine licensed by a national or international medicines
                     licensing authority. These documents are known as "product label," "package insert," "prescribing information," "product information,"
                     "medicines information,"  "summary of product characteristics," and many others. The precise definition and content of product
                     labeling usually varies depending on the country. (For example, in the U.S., all written, printed, or graphic matter accompanying
                     a drug product is called "labeling." For human prescription drugs, the "content of labeling" includes all text tables and
                     figures in the labeling described in 21CFR 201.57.) Implementers of this standard should refer to regulations, definitions
                     and guidances applicable for the realm in which the standard will be used.
                  </p>
                  <p>An SPL document is created by an organization that is required by law to submit product information document because it is
                     responsible for the creation or marketing of a product, or any other person or organization compelled by other motives to
                     submit information about products, whether originally created or not. This includes, original manufacturers, repackagers,
                     relabelers, and public agencies or private information publishers that submit product information documents. Recipients of
                     product label documents are any person or organization, including the public at large, or an agent of the public (such as
                     a regulatory authority). The need to create SPL documents is typically governed by legal statutes which set points such as
                     the completion of a new drug application, the change of product information or annual reports as requiring submission of an
                     SPL document.
                  </p>
                  <p>Like most documents, an SPL document has sections and sections contain text (paragraphs, lists, tables); SPL documents can
                     be rendered and published in these standard narrative presentations. At the same time, the SPL specification provides semantic
                     markup that permits extraction of relevant data embedded in the narrative so that it can be used for other purposes. In other
                     words, SPL markup of a product labeling document both preserves the human readability of the content and facilitates machine
                     processing of that content. The document may contain references to media files, such as images, which should accompany the
                     SPL document. However, the wrapping of files is not specified, and guidances to this effect exist by regulatory authorities
                     who accept SPL.
                  </p>
                  <p>SPL is based on the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), which specifies the structure and semantics of "clinical documents"
                     for the purpose of exchange. In earlier releases of SPL the CDA text markup XML schema and its defining text had been copied
                     from the CDA specification. This XML schema is also known as the "narrative block" schema, and included in the SPL XML schema
                     release as NarrativeBlock.xml. This narrative block schema is part of the SPL specification; however, it will no longer be
                     reproduced verbatim but rather will be included into the SPL specification by reference only and only variances between CDA
                     and SPL will be discussed in detail.
                  </p>
                  <p>Even though the SPL specification is based on the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, there are fundamental differences between
                     the two specifications, for example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>CDA documents involve a Patient- SPL documents do not.CDA documents involve one or more Providers- SPL documents do not.CDA documents involve an Encounter- SPL documents do not.The potential for authentication is subtly different for product labeling documents than for CDA documents. While a product
                     labeling document may be authenticated, and may even have a requirement for legal authentication in some realms, this authentication
                     occurs on the official, approved version of the document rather than on each instance (copy) of the document.
                  </ul>
                  <p>The purpose of the SPL specification is to facilitate the review, editing, storage, dissemination of, and access to product
                     labeling document content. It is intended to:
                  </p>
                  <ul>Facilitate provision of the content of product labeling both electronically and in a human readable format.  SPL documents
                     can be exchanged across systems without the need for additional transformation steps.Improve dissemination of product labeling (both new product labeling and product labeling updates) to users of product labeling.
                     The ability to provide the most up-to-date product labeling in a timely manner is considered to be critical to improving risk
                     management of regulated products.Facilitate more efficient evaluation of labeling changes by allowing more effective use of computer technology to compare
                     different versions of labeling on a section by section basis.Promote more coordinated data collection throughout the regulatory agency and improve processing, storage and archiving capabilities.
                     Reduce or eliminate redundancies in data collection.Improve access to information and enhance the ability to query and report on the content of labeling, allowing better support
                     for specific analyses such as sub-population assessments of differences in products based on gender, race, age, and geographic
                     location.Improve interoperability of the regulatory agency's systems with other clinical information systemsUse standards to improve integration of clinical dataEnhance patient safety by helping to provide prescribers and consumers with improved access to information needed to make
                     better risk management decisions in a format that will enhance integration with other technical and clinical applications.Support retention of legacy product labeling in databases
                  </ul>
                  <p>It is important to note that the SPL specification models the structure and semantics of labeling content and not the presentation found in printed labeling! It standardizes the markup of the required content, specifically the structure and semantics of that content. Although the
                     human readability requirement specifies that the content must at the very least be readable using a generic stylesheet that
                     applies to all HL7 structured documents, the use of specialized stylesheets for specific presentation purposes is not prohibited.
                     Limited support for the presentation of content is provided in CDA "narrative block" and has been adopted by SPL.
                  </p>
                  <p>The SPL specification does not specify the creation or management of documents, only their storage and exchange markup. Document
                     management is critically interdependent with the product labeling specification, but the specification of document management
                     messages is outside the scope of the SPL specification.
                  </p>
                  <p>This specification does not address the transfer mechanism for product labeling documents. The specification for messages
                     that might carry the product labeling document is outside the scope of the SPL specification, although the CDA standard does
                     specify how to package clinical documents within HL7 messages. An SPL document may be transmitted in an HL7 message that is
                     designed to transfer clinical documents. Alternatively, several other mechanisms may be used to transfer product labeling
                     including physical media, PDF, electronic transfer of word processing applications, among many others.

                        <p>The SPL specification is a part of HL7 v3 specifications and follows its methodology. According to this methodology, XML Implementation
                           Specification is governed by the rules of the XML Implementation Technology Specification (ITS) and SPL makes no exceptions
                           to this. The XML ITS makes clear that a W3C XML-Schema is provided as informative and useful tool to implementers, but the
                           W3C XML-Schema neither completely defines SPL nor is it an exclusive representative of the XML ITS. Hence, the SPL Schema
                           itself is not normative.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are no deviations in the XML Schema which is generated from the SPL Hierarchical Description (PORP_HD050032). However,
                           it may be noted that the ordering of elements in the HD deviates from the standard ordering of elements in other HL7 v3 HDs.
                           This is done for backwards compatibility as the order of these elements does matter to most XML technology.

                           Most of these attributes have fixed values assigned. In SPL these assignments have been made to the effect that the author-Participation
                           inherits from the Document to all nested Sections unless overridden. Confidentiality and human language codes are also considered
                           part of this context. Because this context always propagates unless overridden, the representation of unknown context is achieved

                     The focus of this section is to highlight these aspects of SPL that cannot be machine validated - particularly those aspects

                     the actual requirements and not mentioning optional steps which were not required. Also those requirements which are simply

                  </p>
                  <p>Recipient responsibilities</p>
                  <ul>Assume default values where they are defined in this specification, and where the instance does not contain a value: Where SPL defines default values, the recipient must assume these values in the event that no value is contained in an SPL
                     instance. This holds regardless of whether or not the SPL Schema supplies the recipient with the default values.Parse and interpret the SPL content sufficiently to be able to render it: A recipient of an SPL document must be able to parse and interpret the SPL document sufficiently to be able to render it,
                     using the following rendering rules:The NonXMLBody, will need to be rendered with a software tool that recognizes its particular MIME media type. Since there can be no guarantee that a recipient can render every possible MIME type, a NonXMLBody may be ignored by a recipient.
                     A sender can only rely on the recipient being able to render a NonXMLBody if there is a prior bilateral agreement. Hence,
                     the NonXMLBody is not plug-and-play interoperable. See also the HL7 Data Type specification for the status of various MIME
                     types.The StructuredBody, must be rendered by the recipient including at least the Section.title, and Section.text (Narrative Block)
                     elements. The absence of the Section.title signifies an unlabeled section.
                  </ul>
                  <p>Originator responsibilities</p>
                  <ul>Properly construct SPL Narrative Blocks: An originator of an SPL document must ensure that the content of the document body is structured such that a recipient, adhering
                     to the recipient responsibilities above, will correctly render the document.

                  <p>This section summarizes the scope of the SPL document and data structures. Formally it was discussed as 'requirements' and
                     split over two parts of the specification. A discussion of requirements can not be actionable normative content. But the material
                     is suitable as a scope statement, providing a summary of data covered by SPL.

                        <p>Product labeling documents should be both human readable and machine processable.</p>
                        <p>Precise requirements regarding metadata for document management have not been established. Therefore, the model contains information
                           that would be required regardless of document management processes (e.g., document identifier [id]) as well as information
                           that may be desired in some realms (e.g., author, legal authenticator).
                        </p>
                        <p>Product labeling documents may be revised or replaced. One document may be a transformation from another.</p>
                        <p>Formatting of documents may vary from one realm to another or one implementation to another.</p>
                        <p>HL7 structured documents contain sections. Product labeling documents tend to be organized into commonly understood sections
                           (e.g., indications, precautions). While there may be a standard set of section names and hierarchies for a product labeling
                           document in a given realm, at this time there is no single international standard product labeling document structure. Product
                           labeling document content and structure is usually specified in regulations. Therefore, the SPL model is deliberately flat
                           and non-hierarchical  the ability to identify and name sections has been provided, but the exact names, order, and nesting
                           of sections are not specified. This provides a high level of flexibility in the model.

                        <p>Product labeling document sections may be revised or replaced on a modular basis.</p>
                        <p>Sections contain narrative text.</p>
                        <p>Sections may contain data elements. Sections may also contain images (e.g., the chemical structure of a drug).</p>

                           is necessary to provide markup of these data, which are referred to in this specification as data elements. The primary intent
                           of data elements defined to date is to facilitate document indexing, search and retrieval, and to provide a standard convention

                  <p>This section contains the normative description of the SPL data structures. In SPL releases 1 and 2, these descriptions were
                     spread over former sections 4, 5 and 6. This material has now been condensed such that each element is described only once
                     and the material has moved entirely into the HL7 v3 specification and publication framework, linked directly to the SPL refined
                     information model (RMIM), and thus will also be available in the Hierarchical Descriptor (HD) and in the XML-Schema. For this
                     purpose the text of the descriptions has undergone some editorial redaction to form more concise definitions without substantially
                     changing any of the previously established meaning.

                        <p>Document: The Structured Product Labeling document as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Document.id: A required, globally-unique instance identifier, which is different from the XML element identifier; see the HL7 Data Types
                           specification for more information about use of globally-unique instance identifiers.
                        </p>
                        <p>Document.setId: An optional globally-unique identifier, that remains constant across all document revisions that derive from a common original
                           document.
                        </p>
                        <p>Document.versionNumber: An optional version number is incremented for each subsequent version of a document. For example, an original document is
                           the first version of a document, and gets a new globally unique "id" value; it can also contain a new value for "setId" and
                           a value of "versionNumber" set to equal "1".
                        </p>
                        <p>Document.code: 
                           A code specifying the type of product labeling document (e.g., prescription drug label or over-the-counter prescription drug
                           label). The externally-defined vocabulary domain for "Document.code" is preferentially drawn from LOINC.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>NOTE: Within the LOINC database, beginning with version 2.09, May 2003, document type codes are those that have a value of
                           "DOC" in the Scale component.
                        </p>
                        <p>Document.title: 
                           Free text entry of the human readable title of the document. It is this title of a document that is rendered. The title describes
                           (but does not guarantee) the content of the document.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>The title is either a simple string (ST) or an XML content (ED) with limited NarrativeBlock markup which allows for stylesCode,
                           super- and sub-script, line breaks and few other functions, but explicitly excludes tables, lists, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>Document.effectiveTime: Document origination time, i.e., a timestamp specifying when the document was created.</p>
                        <p>Document.availabilityTime: The release date of the product labeling document.</p>
                        <p>Participation.time: Other time stamps in the document lifecycle may be recorded through the various participants in the document (see below for
                           a description of people and organizations that play a role in a product labeling document). Each Participation class clone
                           has a required 'time' attribute. Thus, there is a time associated with an Author, Verifier (reviewer), and LegalAuthenticator.
                        </p>
                        <p>Document.confidentialityCode: Specifies confidentiality of the entire document. May be overriden for specific parts of the document. Values may be drawn
                           from the Confidentiality vocabulary domain. Values other than those in the HL7 vocabulary domain (such as local codes) can
                           also be used if necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>Document.languageCode: A code specifying the human language of character data in the product labeling document (whether in contents or attribute
                           values). The values of the attribute are language identifiers as defined by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) RFC
                           3066: Tags for the Identification of Languages, ed. H. Alvestrand, 1995 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt), which obsoletes
                           RFC 1766. Language is a contextual component of SPL, where the value expressed in the header holds true for the entire document,
                           unless overridden by a nested value.
                        </p>
                        <p>RelatedDocument (Participation) (RelatedDocument1): One or more specific relationships between documents. These relationships rely on document identifiers described above.</p>
                        <p>RelatedDocument1.typeCode: The nature of the relationship. For example, a replacement document replaces an existing document, where the document being
                           replaced is referenced via this relationship with a type code of RPLC (for "replaces").
                        </p>
                        <p>RelatedDocument (Act) (RelatedDocument): A reference to another Document. The set of attributes in this class has the purpose of identifying the related document
                           by identifiers only. To learn the contents of the related document, one needs to retrieve that document by the identifier(s)
                           provided here.
                        </p>
                        <p>RelatedDocument.id: Provides unambiguous explicit identification of documents and document revisions. When the RelatedDocument is used to indicate
                           versioning, then each version has a unique document id, and the RelatedDocument.id references the previous document version.
                        </p>
                        <p>RelatedDocument.setId: Can be used to support conventional revision numbering in addition to the explicit links to the ancestor versions using the
                           RelatedDocument.id. One example scenario is: The new replacement Document gets a new globally unique id value, and uses the
                           same value for setId as the RelatedDocument being replaced, and increments the value of versionNumber. The RelatedDocument
                           is then considered superseded, but is still retained in the system for historical reference.
                        </p>
                        <p>RelatedDocument.versionNumber: Can be used to support conventional revision numbering in addition to the explicit links to the ancestor versions using the
                           RelatedDocument.id. One example scenario is: The new replacement Document gets a new globally unique id value, and uses the
                           same value for setId as the RelatedDocument being replaced, and increments the value of versionNumber by 1. (If used, the
                           versionNumber will be incremented by one when a document is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local
                           requirements.) The parent document is considered superseded, but is still retained in the system for historical reference.
                        </p>
                        <p>AssignedEntity: 
                           Possible persons and organizations involved in the creation and review of a product labeling document are associated with
                           the document as Participations. Participations may include document originators (authors), legal authenticators, organizations
                           that own the marketing authority for the product, and product labeling reviewers at the regulatory agency. Participants are
                           capable of and accountable for their independent decisions. All of these participants are optional in the SPL model but could
                           be constrained to be required for a given realm.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>Information about participants is captured by means of clones of several interrelated RIM classes: Participations, Roles,
                           and Entities. In general, an Entity (person or organization) playing a particular Role (in this case, AssignedEntity), participates
                           in an Act (e.g., a document). It is the Participation clone that identifies the type of participant. The type of Participation
                           (e.g., author) is indicated by a code. The Role played by the Entity establishes that entity's competency or authority to
                           participate as indicated. For example, a person participating as an author of a label is only authorized to do so if assigned
                           by the organization responsible for authorship of the label.
                        </p>
                        <p>The way in which a Person or Organization is participating in the document is specified by the typeCode attribute on the relevant
                           Participation class clone. While the nature of the participation may be suggested by the XML element name, the typeCode values
                           are the definitive indication.
                        </p>
                        <p>Author: A Participation clone that links a Document (or Section) to the Person who originated the document (or section, respectively),
                           and, through AssignedEntity, also links to the Organization that owns the document. If desired, the author(s) of specific
                           sections can be identified using the same structures as it is done for Document.author, which will then override the author(s)
                           specified for the Document. (Note: In the SPL RMIM, this class is represented as a "shadow" of the author class for document,
                           indicating that this participation is used by both the section and the document classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Author.typeCode: The way in which a Person or Organization is participating in the document is specified by the typeCode attribute on the
                           relevant Participation class clone. While the nature of the participation may be suggested by the XML element name, the typeCode
                           values are the definitive indication.
                        </p>
                        <p>Author.time: The time of participation by the author (usually the time of origination).</p>
                        <p>LegalAuthenticator: 
                           In some realms there may be a requirement to capture a legal authenticator of the labeling content. A legally authenticated
                           document exists when an individual with the proper legal authority has attested to the accuracy of the document content. A
                           document can be legally authenticated by zero or more people.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>Requirements for capture of information about a potential legal authenticator have not been defined to date. However, in the
                           case where a local document is transformed into a SPL document for exchange, authentication only occurs on the local document
                           and the fact of authentication is reflected in the exchanged SPL document. An SPL document can reflect the unauthenticated
                           or authenticated state. The unauthenticated state exists when no authentication information has been recorded (i.e., it is
                           the absence of being authenticated).
                        </p>
                        <p>LegalAuthenticator.typeCode: The way in which a Person or Organization is participating in the document is specified by the typeCode attribute on the
                           relevant Participation class clone. While the nature of the participation may be suggested by the XML element name, the typeCode
                           values are the definitive indication.
                        </p>
                        <p>LegalAuthenticator.time: The time of participation by the legal authenticator (the time at which the document was authenticated, i.e., signed).</p>
                        <p>LegalAuthenticator.signatureCode: Document the existence of a signature if the value for signatureCode is "S" (for "signed"). Authentication involves signing
                           of the document either manually or electronically by the responsible individual. The electronic signature mechanism that uses
                           the RIM attributes Participation.signatureText and Role.certificateText, is currently not included in SPL.
                        </p>
                        <p>Verifier: Represents reviewers, typically within the regulatory agency, where the AssignedEntity.representedOrganization provides details
                           about the organization (e.g., the regulatory agency) for which the verifier is working. (It is possible to indicate reviewers
                           of a different organization, such as the manufacturer itself, the representedOrganization specification will tell what level
                           of review the Verifier participation represents.)
                        </p>
                        <p>Verifier.typeCode: The way in which a Person or Organization is participating in the document is specified by the typeCode attribute on the
                           relevant Participation class clone. While the nature of the participation may be suggested by the XML element name, the typeCode
                           values are the definitive indication.
                        </p>
                        <p>Verifier.time: Indicates the time of participation by the verifier (usually the time of review).</p>
                        <p>Verifier.signatureCode: Document the existence of a signature if the value for signatureCode is "S" (for "signed"). Verification may involve signing
                           of the document either manually or electronically by the responsible individual. The electronic signature mechanism that uses
                           the RIM attributes Participation.signatureText and Role.certificateText, is currently not included in SPL.
                        </p>
                        <p>Person: The AssignedEntity.assignedPerson, provides the details (e.g., name) about the person participating in the document as an
                           author. Because assignedPerson is optional, it is possible to capture only information about the representedOrganization.
                        </p>
                        <p>Organization: The AssignedEntity.representedOrganization provides details about the organization (the manufacturer or owner of the marketing
                           authority) for which the author is working. This specifies the organization from which the document originates and that is
                           in charge of maintaining the document (e.g., the owner of the marketing authority or a contractor in charge of the labeling),
                           commonly called the manufacturer.
                        </p>
                        <p>StructuredBody: Represents an XML document body that is comprised of one or more Sections.</p>
                        <p>NonXMLBody: Represents a document body that is in some format other than SPL XML (e.g., a PDF document.)</p>
                        <p>Section: 
                           Provides a means of organizing the product labeling content into the commonly understood sections generally found in these
                           documents. The Section class is a container used to wrap other containers. A section element can occur in the StructuredBody,
                           or can be nested within another Section. A section can also be replaced by another section. A section can contain nested section
                           elements or other structures such as observations.
                           The SPL section contains the actual product labeling text and graphics to be rendered.  There are three logical components
                           of the SPL section:
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>(1) General section information.</p>
                        <p>(2) Information about participants in creation of the section.</p>
                        <p>(3) The actual product labeling text and graphics to be included in the label section (and which will be rendered), along
                           with structured data elements (that may be used for machine processing).
                        </p>
                        <p>The mechanisms to uniquely identify a specific product labeling section, to indicate a standard type code and name for the
                           section, and to include a local name for the section (e.g. realm or language specific name; possibly constrained by the type
                           code) are all included.
                        </p>
                        <p>Note the section element contains an optional local identifier (represented as an XML ID attribute) that can serve as the
                           target of an XML reference.
                        </p>
                        <p>Section.id: A globally-unique instance identifier, which is different from the XML ID attribute; see the HL7 Data Types specification
                           for more information about use of globally-unique instance identifiers.
                        </p>
                        <p>Special XML attribute Section/@ID (Section.ID): In XML rendition of SPL, the section-element contains an optional local identifier (represented as an XML ID attribute) that
                           can serve as the target of a reference.
                        </p>
                        <p>Section.code: A code that describes (but does not guarantee) the content of the section. The externally-defined vocabulary domain for Section.code
                           may be drawn from LOINC. However, because the coding strength is CWE, the code set may be extended locally. Examples of possible
                           section codes include: Indications and usage, Dosage and administration, Contraindications, Warnings, Drug interactions, Adverse
                           reactions
                        </p>
                        <p>Section.title: An optional free text entry of the human readable title of the section. It is the title of a section that is rendered. The
                           title describes (but does not guarantee) the content of the section. (It is important to note that title is optional, and
                           sections should be created for logical sub-units of the document, whether they have titles or not.)
                        </p>
                        <p>Section.effectiveTime: Interval of time, specifying the section origination time, i.e., when the section was created.</p>
                        <p>Section.confidentialityCode: Can override the confidentialityCode attribute in Document.</p>
                        <p>Section.languageCode: Specifies the human language of character in the same way that Document.languageCode works. Language is a contextual component
                           of SPL, where the value expressed in the header holds true for the entire document, unless overridden by a nested value 
                        </p>
                        <p>Section.text: 
                           The attribute that holds narrative to be rendered and is a special hand-crafted content model (the same as Section.text in
                           CDA) that is part of the SPL standard. The SPL schema incorporates by reference the NarrativeBlock schema for this content
                           model. The content model for Section.text is defined by the Clinical Document Architecture specification (currently section
                           4.3.5  Section Narrative Block), to which normative reference is hereby made.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>While the Narrative Block schema defined by the Clinical Document Architecture is the only allowed content model for Section.text.
                           Updates have been made to it since the last release and ballot of CDA in collaboration between the Structured Document Technical
                           Committee and the SPL Group.
                        </p>
                        <p>The content revised attribute has an additional value of revised in addition to the existing values insert and delete. This
                           can be used to mark text as revised without specifying in detail the nature of the change.
                        </p>
                        <p>ReplacementOf: An explicit representation of the relationships between versions of sections. Whether and how this information is used depends
                           on the document management system in use. A replacement section replaces an existing section.
                        </p>
                        <p>ReplacementOf.typeCode: The value of RPLC for "replacement of" as contained in the ActRelationshipType vocabulary domain.</p>
                        <p>SectionReplaced: A section that is related to the section it replaces through the replacementOf relationship (an ActRelationship clone).</p>
                        <p>Observation (DEPRECATED) (Observation): Allowed inserting free-standing codes and other observations into SPL documents. Because this function has no interoperable
                           definition and no requirement and can overlap with the explicit SPL data structures it has been deprecated since release 2
                           or SPL, it will be discarded shortly. Use Characteristic instead, which better relates the characteristics with the thing
                           so characterized.
                        </p>
                        <p>ObservationMedia: Holds multi-medial content, that is logically a part of a product labeling document, but may be stored outside the document
                           and incorporated by reference. Multimedia that is integral to a document, and part of the attestable content of the document,
                           requires the use of observationMedia. (An example might be the molecular structure for a drug in a drug product labeling document.)
                           Multimedia that is simply referenced by the document and not an integral part of the document can use linkHtml. The XML ID
                           attribute on the observationMedia element is used by the renderMultiMedia element (of the Narrative Block) to identify the
                           media to be rendered.
                        </p>
                        <p>ObservationMedia.id: An ObservationMedia class contains an optional instance identifier.</p>
                        <p>Special XML attribute ObservationMedia/@ID (ObservationMedia.ID): The XML ID attribute on the observationMedia element is used by the renderMultiMedia element to identify the media to be
                           rendered (renderMultiMedia).
                        </p>
                        <p>ObservationMedia.value: Encoded data (ED) which contains the media data either inline or by reference.</p>
                        <p>Section as Subject of Comments (Subject8): Links a comment to a section. The comment does not participate in the context of the document, i.e., is never assumed to
                           be attributed to the document or section author and is not considered part of the document.
                        </p>
                        <p>Comment: 
                           Editorial comments much like the comments which can be attached to text with some word processors. Comment.text contains the
                           free text of the comment.  The comment can reference a precise location in the section text using the TextFragmentReference.
                           The following is an example:

                        <p>A comment should be attributed to an author but this author is separate from the document author (explicitly not inherited).
                           Even if no specific author is assigned to a Comment, such Comment is not automatically attributed to the document or section
                           author. A Comment is not even considered part of the Section; it only references the Section and can be sent along with a
                           Section but might be stripped from the Section without such stripping being considered an alteration of the Section.
                        </p>
                        <p>Comment.text: The free text of the comment. Uses the same Narrative Block schema as the Section.text itself.</p>
                        <p>Comment.statusCode: Distinguishes comments that are open issues (active) from those that had been resolved (complete).</p>
                        <p>SequelTo: Links to an earlier comment, such that one commenter can respond to another comment. When linking comments, the response
                           to a comment is nested as a sequel/comment inside the comment element to which it responds.
                        </p>
                        <p>Specific Subject of a Comment (Subject9): Allows narrowing the subject of the comment down to a specific fragment inside the Section.text.</p>
                        <p>TextFragmentReference: References a specific fragment in the section text using the XML ID attributes on the content element in the section.</p>
                        <p>TextFragmentReference.text: The reference to the text, using the referencing function of the ED data type, i.e., as a URL with a fragment reference,
                           where the fragment is typically created by a content element with an XML ID attribute as defined in the Narrative Block schema
                           (see Section.text).

                        <p>Medicine: 
                           The medicine is the primary unit which is manufactured and the object of an intended substance administration and is not just
                           packaging. Examples are tablet, capsule, solution for injection, powder.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>Conversely, vial and bottle are containers, which though necessary for handling of the medicine, are not administered to the
                           patient, but emptied into some other solution, or used with an injection or inhalation device. Notice, even though a capsule
                           can be considered a container holding granules, capsules are still considered primary Medicines not PackagedMedicines, because
                           the capsule is the unit normally intended for administration, and so the capsule is the medicine. In this way, a solution
                           packaged in an administration unit, such as a dragee or a prefilled syringe may be considered primary Medicines rather than
                           PackagedMedicines, if it is intended to be applied completely as one unit, and not subdivided. This requires that the ingredients
                           of such medicines are specified as a total amount per complete application rather than as a concentration.
                        </p>
                        <p>A kit, which is a collection of parts which are administered together or used in some intricate way are sometimes also described
                           as primary Medicine with parts. The key criterion is that the kit as a whole is considered the object of a SubstanceAdministration.
                        </p>
                        <p>Medicine.name: The proprietary or brand name.</p>
                        <p>Medicine.formCode: The dosage form of the drug. Values may be drawn from the MaterialForm HL7 vocabulary table or from other external code value
                           sources. Notice the difference between an (Administered) Medicine and a PackagedMedicine. Both have formCodes. A box or vial
                           is usually not a Medicine.formCode, unless the entire box or the entire vial is meant for direct administration as a single
                           unit.
                        </p>
                        <p>ManufacturedProduct: A Role of the Medicine as a ManufacturedProduct is taken as the principal role for the SPL medication model.</p>
                        <p>EntityWithGeneric: Relationship that links to the non-proprietary, generic substance as which the same medicines is known in the literature
                           independent of a specific manufacturer.

                        <p>PharmaceuticalClass: A generalization of Medicine, Substance and ActiveMoiety, can specify any or all of (a) cellular/molecular action (e.g.,
                           Ca-channel blocker); (b) physiologic action (e.g., vasodilator); and (c) molecular/chemical class (e.g. aminopenicillin).

                        <p>PackagedMedicine: A medicine in a container, or package.</p>
                        <p>PackagedMedicine.code: Specifies the product code for a packaged product (e.g., National Drug Code [NDC] in the U.S.)</p>
                        <p>PackagedMedicine.formCode: The package type, such as "box" or "bottle".</p>
                        <p>Content3: 
                           A role representing the relationship between an (inner) package and its larger (outer) package,
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>The ability to go from a smaller package to a larger package is new in SPL release 3 and is the standard way to describe "intermediate"
                           packaging, which regularly occur with non-solid medicines. For example, a solution for injection (Medicine) is packaged in
                           a vial (a primary package or sometimes called "intermediary" package) and then several such vials are packed in a carton.
                           Notice that the vial is not the Medicine, it is the content in the vial which is the medicine; the vial is just a necessary
                           packaging to hold the liquid.
                        </p>
                        <p>Content3.quantity: A ratio which specifies how many small entities (numerator) are in a big entity (denominator).</p>
                        <p>Part: A component of a multiple component product [e.g., estrogens, progestins and inert tablets of a contraceptive product.  Multicomponent
                           products such as contraceptives (e.g., separate estrogens and progestins in a single container), can be represented where
                           each drug would be a Part of the parent contraceptive medicine, and the quantity of each represented as a Part.quantity. (The
                           quantity of the parent Medicine would be "1" for a single wheel containing both medications in this example.)
                        </p>
                        <p>Part.quantity: A ratio specifying the amount of a part (numerator) in an amount (denominator) of the whole Medicine. It is important to
                           note that as all Role quantities the numerator and denominator stand for the amount of the exact kind of entity specified
                           as the part and whole respectively, and not something else. For example, when the medicine is a kit with tablets being the
                           parts, the numerator numbers the amount of tablets of the same kind in the kit. However, if the kit consists of 2 vial-packaged
                           liquids, each vial holding 3 mL, the part quantity specifies the total amount of this liquid (e.g. 6 mL), not 2 (vials). Thus
                           all quantities have the exact same interpretation which is important to draw any quantitative inference from these relationships
                           (e.g. "how much ingredient is in a package?")
                        </p>
                        <p>Content2: 
                           A role representing the relationship between a package and its contained smaller packages (deprecated).
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>This third variant of packaging relationship is deprecated and replaced by the part-relationship introduced in release 2.
                           It is retained for a limited time for backwards compatibility as it was present in SPL release 1. This would allow specifying
                           sub-containers of a larger container. However, using this method, there would be no way to specify the content of those sub-containers.
                           The use case for this has now been addressed with the Part role which is used to show parts of the overall product where each
                           part can have its own packaging.

                        <p>Characteristic: A code-value pair specifying descriptive properties of the medicine, such as color, shape, imprints, etc. The code has a
                           data type of CE and the value has a data type of ANY, which allows codes or numeric values to be specified.
                        </p>
                        <p>Characteristic.code: 
                           A code specifying which characteristic of the medicine is being described. The vocabulary domain is MedicationObservationType
                           (a CWE domain which can be extended as necessary). For example, some values that are contained in the SPLLabelData value set
                           within the MedicationObservationType vocabulary domain are listed below:

                        <p>Approval.statusCode: Tells whether approval was granted (complete) or whether the approval is presently in progress (active).  Thus, a substance
                           or product that is not approved yet but about which an approval is in process and approval number is known can also have the
                           Approval structure but must indicate a status of "active" in the Approval.statusCode.  Likewise, a substance or product whose
                           approval has been withdrawn would have a statusCode of "obsolete".
                        </p>
                        <p>Author2: The author of the Approval signifies the Territory (country or state) for which approval was granted, with optionally some

                        <p>TerritorialAuthority: A Role linking the medicinal product oversight Agency (e.g. "U.S. FDA") with its Country of jurisdiction. The purpose of
                           this role is to allow either the Country code alone or the Agency or both to be specified as the author of approvals.
                        </p>

                        <p>Highlight: 
                           An abstract or excerpt of a single topic discussed in a single section or sub-section.  This abstract is presented in the
                           form of a short text fragment as well as with structured information.  The highlights are targeted at prescribers and judiciously
                           chosen to present the most important information the prescriber needs to know in order to prescribe a medicine safely and
                           effectively. 
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>The Highlights can be assembled to form a short abstract of the comprehensive prescribing information as a "quick reference"
                           for the prescriber.

                        <p>All structured information to specify the clinical use of the drug is connected through the highlights element. The practical
                           purpose of this construct is to focus the coding of information on the most important points guiding the appropriate use of
                           the medicine without attempting to code nuances which would not be part of a concise summary. It also facilitates review of
                           the structured information for correctness. Specific information structures cover the general topics: Indication, Dosage and
                           Administration, Adverse Events, Interactions, Contraindications and other Cautions or Warnings, as well as Monitoring guidelines.
                        </p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministration Defining Appropriate Use (SubstanceAdministration1): Since the clinical medication module is all about appropriate and safe use of the drug, this "use" of the drug, i.e., the
                           central SubstanceAdministration is the pivot of all structured data of the highlights.  This SubstanceAdministration is a
                           definition and defines the key data of a proper use of the medicine.
                        </p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministration1.effectiveTime: 
                           Timing patterns (e.g., twice a day, every 8 hours, etc.) and timing boundaries (e.g., for 10 days) can be specified for the
                           main SubstanceAdministration and its component SubstanceAdministration.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition, SubstanceAdministration.effectiveTime can give general timing constraints, such as, "give 1 hour before meal".
                           However, more specific clinical situations in which to give the medicine (e.g., "15 minutes before exercise" or "before sexual
                           intercourse", etc.) must be specified using preconditions to a ClinicalSituationCriterion.
                        </p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministration1.doseQuantity: Amount of the medicine given at one single administration. The medicine in terms of which this dose is specified can be clarified
                           using the consumable participation which leads either to the Medicine or to an ActiveIngredient. This can be specified by
                           means of reference to the ManufacturedProduct.id or the ActiveIngredient.id, without requiring repeating the detail of these
                           roles and entities playing the roles.
                        </p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministration1.maxDoseQuantity: A ratio specifying a "do not exceed" dose, as a maximum dose (see doseQuantity) over a period of time. E.g. maximum amount
                           per any time interval, e.g., 4 g in any 24-hour period.
                        </p>
                        <p>Indication (Reason): 
                           An ActRelationship of type "reason" representing the indication of the substance administration by linking to an observation
                           criterion. The typeCode of the reason ActRelationship can be further refined to indicate different motivations, such as therapeutic
                           reason (as a remedy), prophylactic reason (as a means of prevention), or as diagnostic reason (something done to diagnose
                           the disease.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>Reason.typeCode: The typeCode of the reason ActRelationship can be further refined to indicate different motivations, such as therapeutic
                           reason (as a remedy), prophylactic reason (as a means of prevention), or as diagnostic reason (something done to diagnose
                           the disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>IndicationObservationCriterion: An observation criterion that is specified as the "reason" (ActRelationship) of the SubstanceAdministration.  The observation
                           criterion consists of a code to indicate that the observation is a diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, etc. and a value-code
                           to represent the specific indication, e.g. hypertension, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>IndicationObservationCriterion.code: A code indicating that the observation is a diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, etc.</p>
                        <p>IndicationObservationCriterion.value: A value-code representing the specific indication, e.g. hypertension, etc.</p>
                        <p>Precondition: An ActRelationship that links ClinicalSitutaionCriteria with the pivotal SubstanceAdministration. A ClinicalSituationCriterion
                           is a choice of either ObservationCriterion, SubstanceAdministrationCriterion or general ActCriterion. These preconditions
                           further limit the indication to a specific population or other clinical situation. Multiple preconditions can be specified.
                           When multiple criteria are specified, they are logically conjoined (AND), i.e., they must all hold true.
                        </p>
                        <p>Precondition.pauseQuantity: Specifies a certain time constraint between the clinical situation and the use of the drug. E.g., "use 15 minutes before
                           exercise" or "X should be given at least 8 hours after Y".
                        </p>
                        <p>ObservationCriterion: The ObservationCriterion is similar to the IndicationObservationCriterion with a code and a value, but the value can express
                           both coded and quantitative data types for clinical conditions as well as, for instance, age ranges.  The clinical situation
                           criteria can be stated positively as requirements (e.g. patient over 12 years of age) or negatively as limitations or exclusion
                           criteria (e.g., not for patient under 12 years of age.)
                        </p>
                        <p>ObservationCriterion.code: A code indicating that the observation is a diagnosis, symptom, condition, lab-observation, etc.</p>
                        <p>ObservationCriterion.value: The value of the observation, i.e. a specific condition code (e.g. hypertension, renal failure, etc.), or, in case of numeric
                           observations a physical quantity.
                        </p>
                        <p>TherapeuticClass: 
                           The treatment class allows to give a code that classifies the intent of the treatment, i.e., "antihypertensive". These classifications
                           are sometimes considered properties of the substance and in that case are specified as the classifying codes (generalization)
                           of the substance or product.  However, some substances have multiple purposes, and it is that purpose that eventually determines
                           the proper dosage.  This is sometimes known as indication "grouping".
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>Note: Two mechanisms are specified to represent grouping or classifications of the drug substances on the one hand and their
                           use on the other hand. Pharmacologic class (e.g., aminopenicillin, aminoglycosides, etc.) or mechanism of action (e.g., MAO
                           inhibitor, ACE inhibitor, Ca-channel blocker, beta-2-blocker, etc.) is a classification of drug substances, either of drug
                           products, their active ingredients or active moiety, and all represented by generalization Roles to a PharmaceuticalClass.
                           Classification of treatment intent (e.g., antihypertensive, antiphlogistic, antiinferctive, etc.) are classifications of the
                           SubstanceAdministration act, and represented as a generalization of the treatment act through the generalization ActRelationship
                           to TreatmentClass.
                        </p>
                        <p>Adverse Situation (Issue): Adverse events, interactions, contraindications and other issues of special caution are represented in one uniform structure.
                           The Pharmacy SIG has established a special kind of Act, called Issue for this purpose.  An Issue has one or more other Acts
                           as subjects and indicate that there is a certain problem requiring special caution with its subject Acts.  In the case of
                           SPL, the subject is the SubstanceAdministration described in the label.  One or more additional subjects can be used to specify
                           additional ClinicalSituationCriteria such as ObservationCriteria or SubstanceAdministrationCriteria.  The latter is used to
                           represent interactions which is an Issue involving the administration of two substances.
                        </p>
                        <p>Risk: An ActRelationship linking an Issue to a risk, i.e. a coded ConsequenceObservation criterion with information about severity
                           and frequency of the undesired outcome.
                        </p>
                        <p>Adverse Outcome (ConsequenceObservation): An observation criterion specifying the adverse outcome as the usual code-value pair of an observation.</p>
                        <p>CauseOf: The description of the risk can nest to refine to a level of specificity that makes the adverse event actually recognizable.
                           For example, a risk may be specified as a "hypersensitivity syndrome" but then specific manifestations may be given including
                           "rash," or "Guillain-Barré Syndrome", or even quantitative measures as "leukopenia with WBC below 1000/mm3."
                        </p>
                        <p>Severity: A specification of severity of an adverse event as an observation criterion.</p>
                        <p>Frequency: A specification of frequency of occurrence of an adverse event as an observation criterion.</p>
                        <p>ActCriterion: The ActCriterion is a general criterion to give a procedure code or a code of any other clinical service that would be used
                           to limit either positively or negatively the indication of the drug.
                        </p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministrationCriterion: The SubstanceAdministrationCriterion specifies another treatment and is used by Issue to specify an interacting treatment,
                           and with a Precondition to specify adjunctive treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Consumable1: The participation linking the SubstanceAdministrationCritetion with the specification of the other administered substance.</p>
                        <p>MaterialKind: A specificiation of a medicine or food material.</p>
                        <p>MaterialKind.code: Code specifiying medicine or food material. This code often uses the same code systems as the PharmaceuticalClass.</p>
                        <p>MaintenanceGoal2: The indication can be further specified to express an objective as to what the treatment should accomplish.  For instance,
                           if the goal of the treatment is absence of acute asthma attacks, the maintenance goal can describe this.  This is used to
                           allow the treatment effect to be coded and still keep the indication a simple code that is comparable with actual patient
                           problem list data.  For instance, the indication would be "asthma" and the maintenance goal would be "no bronchiospasm" to
                           indicate "prevention of bronchiospasm in patients with asthma".

                        <p>ObservationDefinition: Specifies a kind of Observation which is used for calculated dosage.</p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministration2: A subordinate component SusbtanceAdministration which carries the doseQuantity for a step in a complex dosage plan.  This
                           is used for example, to specify a loading dose, or a tapering dose.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministration2.effectiveTime: Specification of all time aspects of the administration schedule, including frequency and overall duration.</p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministration2.repeatNumber: A regimen with a loading dose is specified using two components, the first representing the initial dose, with repeatNumber
                           = 1 (meaning "once") or any other limitation in number or time.  That first component would be followed by a second component
                           that can repeat for the rest of the duration of the therapy.
                        </p>
                        <p>SubstanceAdministration2.doseQuantity: The doseQuantity, see the same attribute in the pivotal SubstanceAdministration for detail.</p>
                        <p>Protocol: Specifies a safe use protocol wherein a substance administration is recommended to be accompanied by monitoring observations,
                           i.e. tests such as drug level tests, pharamacokinetic parameter tests (renal function), or adverse effect tests (hypotension,
                           liver enzymes) required.  This Protocol contains MonitoringObservation steps and maintenance goals as MonitoringObservationCriteria.
                        </p>
                        <p>MonitoringObservation: Prescribe the tests that should be performed and in what frequency.  MonitoringObservation.code detailing the tests that
                           should be performed (e.g. thrombocytes count, liver enzymes, etc.) The MonitoringObservation.effectiveTime is used to specify
                           the recommended frequency of these tests in the same way as the frequency of SubstanceAdministration is specified.
                        </p>
                        <p>MaintenanceGoal1: Specifies a criterion (e.g., range) within which certain test results should remain, such as blood levels of the drug or
                           its metabolites should remain to ensure efficacy and avoid toxicity.  MonitoringObservation.code specifies the observations
                           that would be performed (e.g. digoxin level, gentamicin level, etc.) and the MonitoringObservation.value specifies a result-value
                           interval with single bounds (e.g. maximal limits) or two bounds (range) that should be maintained throughout the treatment.

                        <p>A drug product manufacturer is required by an applicable territorial medicinal product oversight authority to create a product
                           information document at different points in the product life-cycle. This document contain all the approved information about
                           the nature and use of the medicinal product, and has therefore been negotiated with the oversight agency. At the end of that
                           negotiation the manufacturer submits an SPL document to the oversight authority. The oversight authority in turn may submit
                           the document to public information repositories also.

                     such a format becomes available, this document will be converted so that it can be represented here directly as domain content.
