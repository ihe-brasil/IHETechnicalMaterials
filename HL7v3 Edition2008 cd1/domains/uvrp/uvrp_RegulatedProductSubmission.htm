            <p>Regulatory authorities receive submissions to address a variety of regulatory issues. The information contained in these submissions
               is divided into numerous files (paper and electronic). Frequently, files in one submission are related to files in earlier
               submissions. Because the information is divided into numerous files sent over time, it is often difficult to efficiently process
               and review the information.
            </p>
            <p>The goal of the Regulated Product Submission message is to facilitate the processing and the review of submissions. Accordingly,
               the Regulated Product Submission Refined Message Information Model captures all information required for the efficient processing
               and review of regulatory submissions.
            </p>
            <p>Different product types have different table of contents; that is to say, different lists of topics that must be addressed
               within the submission.  However, the general data layouts of all regulated products are the same. Therefore, the objective
               of the Regulated Product Submission message is to define one message structure that can be used for all regulated products.
               It is intended that this message will be used, worldwide, for regulated products, including but not limited to, foods, medical
               devices, human therapeutics, and veterinary medicine.  It is important to note that the wide range of products that is contemplated
               leads to providing a generic structure for the actual specification.
            </p>
            <p>Please note that Regulated Product Submission is similar to the Medical Records Document Topic.  This is based on the fact
               that both require attention to needs for managing a complex set of documents.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
            <p>The scope of the initial release of this standard is to define the message for submitting information to regulatory authorities.
               This message includes the contents of a regulatory submission and all information needed to process the submission message.
               This message is flexible enough to be used for regulatory submissions for any regulated product. Subsequent releases of the
               standard will provide information about the submission (e.g. information currently collected on application forms) in addition
               to information about the files in the submission.
            </p>
            <p>Although this message can be used for company-to-company communication, the initial intent of this message is for the communication
               from industry to regulatory authority.
            </p>
            <p>The Regulated Clinical Research Information Management Technical Committee invites anyone with additional requirements to
               submit content proposals for future releases of the standard.

                        <p>Over time, an application will typically consist of multiple submissions and regulatory assessments. For example, the marketing
                           application for a drug product can generate multiple regulatory decisions. The first decision may support the initial marketing
                           approval of the product for a specific indication. Subsequent regulatory decisions may approve or deny additional indications
                           for the drug product. The application thus contains multiple submissions, each with their own regulatory action. Each of those
                           submissions (e.g., initial marketing application, supplemental marketing application) would generally be comprised of multiple
                           submissions units. 
                        </p>
                        <p>A submission is made up of one or many submission units.

                              <p>Acme Pharmaceuticals has prepared information relating to its new product - Global Fixit.  This information provides information
                                 about the quality, safety and effectiveness of the product, and consists of many files that Acme has collected over several
                                 years.  Acme has marshaled these files, which are designed to address a previously defined set of categories, into its first
                                 submission unit.  That first submission unit will be sent to a regulatory authority for marketing approval in that jurisdiction.
                                 In this initial submission unit, the submission unit message identifies all of the submitted files, and indicates the document
                                 category or categories that the files belong.  This first submission unit commences the application and represents the first
                                 regulatory submission for that application.

                                 the submission and all related submission units; it is transmitted to the regulatory authority.

                           A submission unit is made up of one submission unit message and many files. Properly defined, the submission unit message
                           concept enables companies to create new submission units from any combination of new and previously submitted files. The submission
                           unit message is processed by the regulatory authority and is integrated into their tracking/review system.

                                 for one of the three studies.  However, these changes are not relevant to the other two studies.  Acme would like the regulatory

                                 other two.  A new submission unit is created that has the new protocol file marked as a replacement for the relevant study.

                        <p>Application systems sending and receiving documents are responsible for meeting all legal requirements for document authentication,
                           confidentiality, and retention. For communications over public media, cryptographic techniques for source/recipient authentication
                           and secure transport of encapsulated documents may be required, and should be addressed with commercially available tools
                           outside the scope of this standard.

                        <p><strong>Document Identification, Revisions, and Addenda </strong></p>
                        <p>An original report is the first version of a report. It gets a new unique value for ContextOfUse.id, a new value for ContextOfUse.setId,
                           and has the value of ContextOfUse.versionNumber set to equal "1". 
                        </p>
                        <p>An addendum is an appendage to an existing report that contains supplemental information. The appendage is itself an original
                           report, as described in the previous paragraph. The related report being appended is referenced via an ActRelationship, where
                           the ActRelationship.typeCode is set to equal "APND" (for "appends"). The related report being appended remains in place and
                           its content and status are unaltered. If the related report is subsequently replaced, the addendum will then be associated
                           with the most current related report in the related report set (see setId). If a new report replaces both the previous report
                           and the addendum, the ContextOfUse.setId will be the same as the previous reports ContextOfUse.setId and will have an ActRelationship.typeCode
                           is set to equal "RPLC" (for "replace") for both the previous report and the addendum.
                        </p>
                        <p>A replacement report replaces an existing report. The replacement report gets a new globally unique ID value, while the replacement
                           report uses the same value for ContextOfUse.setId as the related report being replaced, and increments the value of ContextOfUse.versionNumber
                           by 1. (Note that version number must be incremented by one when a report is replaced, but can also be incremented more often
                           to meet local requirements.) The related report is considered superseded, but is still retained in the system for historical
                           reference. The related report being replaced is referenced via an ActRelationship, where the ActRelationship.typeCode is set
                           to equal "RPLC" (for "replaces").

                        <p><strong>Context of Use (Document) Statuses and Transitions </strong></p>
                        <p>A context of use is a file that is being referenced in a particular submission unit with a particular code value. The same
                           file can have several context of use. Accordingly, it is possible that each context of use of the same file has different
                           statuses. In addition, a context of use is associated to a submission through a submission unit. Thus, it is possible to query
                           all active documents in a approved submission.
                        </p>
                        <p>Documents only assume a subset of the states that other Acts can take on. When a document is released to regulatory authorities,
                           its status becomes "active". Documents that are "active" are rendered "obsolete" when they are replaced with a revision. A
                           document can also be rendered "obsolete"by a status change. If a document is rendered "obsolete", that document can be reactivated.
                           Obsolete documents cannot be revised.
                        </p>
                        <p>In a later phase an active document will end its life when the submission that document belongs to has come to a conclusion.</p>

                        <p><strong>Submission Statuses and Transitions</strong></p>
                        <p>Submissions only assume a subset of the states that other Acts can take on. When a submission is released to regulatory authorities,
                           its status becomes "active" or "In Review". Since the current specification only supports communication from applicant to
                           regulatory authority, only withdrawing and activating a submission is currently supported.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the future, submissions will have the extra states of approvable, not approvable, and approved.</p>

                        <p><strong>Submission Interaction</strong></p>
                        <p>For the scope of this project, all communication from applicant to regulatory authority are in the form of a submission. Note:
                           the current specification does not support a message from the regulatory authority to applicant.
                        </p>
                        <p>Applicant determines it has enough information to warrant sending a submission to a regulatory authority. The applicant can
                           create a new submission, amend an existing submission or withdraw a submission.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>ContextOfUse Codes</strong></p>
                        <p>A document's content is defined by one or more topic codes (e.g. Manufacturer, Introduction, Summary, etc.). The combinations
                           of these topic codes are well defined by product types. A single topic code can be used in different context. For example,
                           in human therapeutic products the combination of the topic codes Chemistry, Drug substance, Manufacturer is a valid document
                           context. If Chemistry has a topic code of 35, Drug substance has a topic code of 71, and Manufacturer has a topic code of
                           140, then the combination of Chemistry, Drug substance, and Manufacturer would have a ContextOfUse code of 35-71-140. In addition,
                           if Drug Product has a topic code of 70, then the combination of Chemistry, Drug Product, and Manufacturer would have a ContextOfUse
                           code of 35-70-140.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition the same ContextOfUse code can be used for multiple products. For example the combination of Chemistry, Drug substance,
                           and Manufacturer would be a valid ContextOfUse code for both Human Therapeutic products as well as Animal Products.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is also common that different product types will use different combinations of the same topic code. For example a Medical
                           Device product would have a ContextOfUse code that specifies a Cover Letter. However, a Human Therapeutic product would have
                           a ContextOfUse code that would combine the topic codes of both Administrative and Cover Letter.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Model Overview</strong></p>
                        <p>As industry moves away from paper submissions, all companies producing regulated products will benefit from having published
                           electronic submission standards. Accordingly, the focus of the initial message allows applicants to submit information electronically.
                           The submitted information is structured as a collection of documents that is organized by report sections.  The actual table
                           of required and optional report sections varies from product to product and is defined by regulatory authorities.
                        </p>
                        <p>Submitted documents are assigned to support one or more report sections. Furthermore, multiple documents can be assigned to
                           a single report section. Since the same information can be submitted to support multiple applications, it is imperative that
                           this standard allows the re-use of data between applications. Re-using data is accomplished by using the Uniform Resource
                           Locator scheme (through the reference property of the ED datatype that is assigned to Act.text) in the File Act. The URL scheme
                           allows the file in one application to provide a reference to a document that was submitted in another application.
                        </p>
                        <p>A single document can be in multiple report sections of an application and can also be in multiple applications. For this
                           reason, we have defined the ContextOfUse Act which provides the relationship of a document to a report section.  Since a submission
                           unit can contain multiple ContextOfUse, this class can be used to indicates each assignment of a document to a section.  Looking
                           across multiple submissions, it is possible to record a single document's context in multiple applications as needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Since this message is primarily focused on document management, it would seem that the ContextOfUse Act would be the obvious
                           choice to the entry point of this message. However, applicants transmit information to regulatory authorities in the form
                           of submission units containing multiple ContextOfUse. These submission units support the overall application. Accordingly,
                           the entry point for this message is the Submission Unit Act.

                        <p>A keyword definition contains name value pairs that are used within the context of an application.  Each keyword is an item
                           of information that provides context for the document(s) in a context of use.  Keywords are used only to further define the
                           context of a ContextOfUse, and the Keywords, by themselves, have no intrinsic value. Since one of the goals of this message
                           was to create one message structure that can be used for all regulated product types, we decided not model individual keywords
                           or keyword groups as classes and relate these classes to specific ContextOfUse codes.
