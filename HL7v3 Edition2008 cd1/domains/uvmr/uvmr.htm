                        <p>The Medical Records domain currently supports clinical document management, and document querying. In the future, it is intended
                           also to support the data exchange needs of applications supporting other medical record functions, including chart location
                           and tracking, deficiency analysis, consents, and release of information. The main purpose of the medical record is to produce
                           an accurate, legal, and legible clinical document that serves as a comprehensive account of healthcare services provided to
                           a patient, and which has the following characteristics:

                                 context of the document.

                           the transcribed documents can vary greatly within a healthcare organization and between organizations. However, the main purpose
                           of the transcription process is to document patient care or diagnostic results in a legible manner; these documents then become
                           part of the legal medical record.

                              <p>
                                 There are a number of privacy and security considerations the reader or implementer of document query messaging should consider
                                 in any given implementation use case for support of cross enterprise, cross application document queries. These concerns are
                                 especially important to help guard against unauthorized re-disclosure of information, and help build confidence that patient
                                 privacy and confidentiality can be upheld. These concerns include how evidence of a requestor's authorization may be provided
                                 or made available to provide validation to the recipient of the request that the requestor is making a valid request for release
                                 of information, how the recipient of the request has an appropriate level of trust (contractually, technically or legally)
                                 with the requestor and how patient rights to know of disclosures of personal health information may be enabled through auditing
                                 of such disclosures.   There may be additional functional requirements and implementation requirements at the realm level.
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p>The prerequisites for privacy and security interests to be appropriately served in document query transacting are as follows:
                                 
                              </p>

                                       These prerequisites outline the security requirements that should be in place to assure the trust relationship exists, and
                                       that the communication is done in a secure manner. They include: [1] Support for the confidentiality and integrity of the
                                       message itself through the use of appropriate security measures (e.g. encryption) [2] That the transmission is done in a secure
                                       manner [3] That the sender and receiver of the message perform mutual authentication to ensure the transmission is directed
                                       to the appropriate recipient.

                                    <p><strong>Patient Rights protected/upheld: </strong>These prerequisites enable a patient to be confident that disclosures of personal health information are properly authorized,
                                       and that such authorization is verifiable. The identity of the requesting party is specifically known, and is not anonymous
                                       from verification. Users of systems that facilitate making a request for release of information are subject to authorization
                                       enabled by access control policies to assure proper access to personal health information. Prerequisites in this area include:
                                       [1]That user identities are known and authenticated for requestors of releases of information; [2] That user access permissions
                                       are established by access control policies enabled within the systems from which document query requests are made; [3] That
                                       positive identification is possible and specific to the initiator of the query whether a person, an organization (location)
                                       or a trusted identified application recipient representing the user (or proxied to by the user); [4] That the requestor commits
                                       to abide by terms of any applicable patient consent/authorization for release of information; [5] That  the user/intended
                                       recipient is authorized (and validated) to be the recipient in accordance with patient consent or written authorization, a
                                       court order, as permitted by law or regulation, as supported by a manually validated request (such as for a release for law
                                       enforcement purposes);  [6] That evidence of the authorization exists and can be validated programmatically (through evidence
                                       of the authorization provided within the context of the request) or through human procedural verification with identification
                                       of the method and responsibility for validation 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>These measures help assure that the request for documents is authorized under proper authority, and that the identity and
                                       accountability of the requestor is established and verifiable by the recipient of the request for release of information.

                                    <p><strong>Audit trails of disclosures to be enabled: </strong>
                                       Patients have the right to request an accounting of disclosures of to whom their personal health information has been disclosed.
                                       Different types of disclosures may be included in that accounting based on the requirements of prevailing law/regulation and
                                       policy. All disclosures need to be made auditable on that basis. The audit trail should incorporate, but not necessarily be
                                       limited to, information that identifies the party to whom the disclosure was made, who made the disclosure, when the disclosure
                                       occurred, what was the subject matter disclosed and why the disclosure occurred.
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>The above prerequisites are seen as elemental to providing the supporting infrastructure for solicited document query processing
                                 to occur in a secure manner that upholds patient privacy and the confidentiality of personal health information.     
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p>Within the document query message structure itself, there are also several prerequisite requirements that should be in place
                                 for a normative document query standard to be successful. These must be contained within the query message structure, and
                                 must exist prior to the fulfillment of a query. These include: [1] If the release requires patient permission, then the appropriate
                                 means of assuring support for  non-repudiation (e.g. through electronic signature or through in person identity verification)
                                 and unique identification is required for all participants in the release of information for  authentication of patients/legal
                                 representatives, witnesses and providers as signatories that may be incorporated on consent forms; [2] Standard identifiers
                                 must be included for reference to intended recipients (e.g. such as the National Provider Identifier (NPI) in the US or as
                                 appropriate for the use of other external references); [3] Inclusion of the automated release of information up to and including
                                 the electronically signed (non-repudiated) release of information itself or, if not fully automatable, then the message structure
                                 should include the identity of the individual performing the external validation of the appropriateness of the release and
                                 the date/time of the external validation.  
                              </p>
                              <p>Implementers should be aware of the significance of ensuring satisfaction of these prerequisites prior to attempting to use
                                 the document query messages for support of release of information activities for solicited queries.

                              <p>A clinical document can be replaced by a new document and/or appended with an addendum.</p>
                              <p>A replacement document is a new version of the parent document. The parent document is considered superseded, but a system
                                 may retain it for historical or auditing purposes. The parent document being replaced is referenced via act relationship relatedDocument,
                                 where relatedDocument.typeCode is set to equal "RPLC" (for "replaces"). An example is a report found to contain an error that
                                 is subsequently replaced by the corrected report. 
                              </p>
                              <p>An addendum is a separate document that references the parent document, and may extend or alter the observations in the prior
                                 document. The parent document remains a current component of the patient record, and the addendum and its parent are both
                                 read by report recipients. The parent report (represented by the ParentDocument class) being appended is referenced via act
                                 relationship relatedDocument, where relatedDocument.typeCode is set to equal "APND" (for "appends"). 
                              </p>
                              <p>Every clinical document must have a unique ClinicalDocument.id, and thus the replacement or addendum documents each have ClinicalDocument.id
                                 that is different from that of the parent document. Clinical documents may also contain a ClinicalDocument.setId and a ClinicalDocument.versionNumber,
                                 which together support a document identification and versioning scheme used in some document management systems. In this scheme,
                                 all documents in a chain of replacements have the same ClinicalDocument.setId and are distinguished by an incrementing ClinicalDocument.versionNumber.
                                 The initial version of a document gets a new unique value for ClinicalDocument.id, a new value for ClinicalDocument.setId,
                                 and has the value of ClinicalDocument.versionNumber set to equal "1". A replacement document gets a new globally unique ClinicalDocument.id
                                 value, and uses the same value for ClinicalDocument.setId as the parent report being replaced, and increments the value of
                                 ClinicalDocument.versionNumber by 1. (Note that version number must be incremented by one when a report is replaced, but can
                                 also be incremented more often to meet local requirements.)

                        <p>The Medical Records Query-by-Parameter model is used to retrieve documents from a document repository. Parameters reference

                        <p>Details of the Query-by-Parameter approach can be found in the Query Infrastructure chapter, where descriptions of the ControlActProcess
                           and SortControl classes can be found.

                        The representation of And/Or logic in the Query-by-Parameter message is based on the cardinality of associations and parameter
                        item values in the query message.

                              <p>If the parameter can occur no more than once in an instance, then the cardinality of the association in the query model is
                                 [0..1]. Otherwise, the cardinality is [0..*].
                              </p>
                              <p>Where multiple parameters appear in a query instance (e.g. both ClinicalDocument.code and Performer.id), a matching document
                                 shall include all of the values (e.g. shall match one of the ClinicalDocument.code values AND shall match one of the Performer.id
                                 values).

                           into a lifetime electronic patient record.
                        </p>
                        <p>The main components of the model include information about the document, such as encounter data, various participants, related
                           documents; and the document itself. When sending a document encapsulated inside a medical records message, the strong preference
                           is to send one that conforms to the ANSI HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) specification. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The HL7 Reference Information Model is the definitive source of definitions for classes and definitions. What follows are
                           special considerations for the referenced RIM components as they are used in this model. Note that at no time do the comments
                           presented here conflict with the RIM, but instead further constrain the RIM definitions.

                              <p><strong>ClinicalDocument.id: </strong>Represents the globally unique instance identifier of this version of a clinical document. (See section <b>(The user identified specification hmrcmr 
                                    is not available)</b> in Introduction and Scope above).

                              <p><strong>ClinicalDocument.code: </strong>The code specifying the particular kind of document (e.g. History and Physical, Discharge Summary, Progress Note). Values
                                 are preferably drawn from LOINC. (Within the LOINC database, beginning with version 2.09, May 2003, document type codes are
                                 those that have a value of "DOC" in the Scale component).

                              <p><strong>ClinicalDocument.title: </strong>Represents the title of the document. It's commonly the case that clinical documents do not have a title, and are collectively
                                 referred to by the display name of ClinicalDocument.code (e.g. a "consultation" or "progress note").

                              <p><strong>ClinicalDocument.text: </strong>The ClinicalDocument.text attribute uses an encapsulated data (ED) type. The components of this data type can be used to transmit
                                 a document file name and/or URL (ED.reference), and document format or media type (ED.type). If message type is RCMR_MT000002
                                 then ClinicalDocument.text shall include exactly 1 clinical document, with all its authenticated content (with or without
                                 associated stylesheet(s)) in ED.BIN. The mechanism for packaging an HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) document in ClinicalDocument.text
                                 is described in the CDA specification. 
                              </p>
                              <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Message RCMR_MT000002 is to be used when including the document itself. The ED.BIN component cannot be used in RCMR_MT000001.

                              <p><strong>ClinicalDocument.availabilityTime: </strong>Signifies the time a document was made available for patient care. This value is NULL when statusCode is "NEW", and is required
                                 when statusCode is "ACTIVE" or "COMPLETED".

                              <p><strong>ClinicalDocument.confidentialityCode: </strong>It is customary, but not required, that the value of confidentialityCode be set equal to the most restrictive confidentialityCode
                                 of any of the document parts.

                              <p><strong>ClinicalDocument.copyTime: </strong>Time a document is released (i.e., copied or sent to a display device) from a document management system that maintains revision
                                 control over the document.  Once valued, cannot be changed.  Intent of this attribute is to give the viewer of the document
                                 some notion as to how long the document has been out of the safe context of its document management system.
                              </p>

                        <p><strong>Document Relationships</strong></p>
                        <p>This section describes clones related to the root ClinicalDocument class via an ActRelationship.</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>ParentDocument: </strong>This class represents the target of a document relationship. The target is either being appended, revised, or transformed
                                 by the source document. See section "Document Identification, Revisions, and Addenda" in Introduction and Scope above for
                                 further details. See the discussion of ClinicalDocument for attribute level descriptions. ParentDocument.text can be used
                                 to indicate the MIME type of the related document. It is not to be used to embed the related document, and thus ParentDocument.text.BIN
                                 is precluded from use. 
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p><strong>ServiceEvent: </strong>This class represents the main Act, such as a colonoscopy or an appendectomy, being documented. 
                              </p>
                              <p>In some cases, the ServiceEvent is inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, such as where ClinicalDocument.code is "History
                                 and Physical Report" and the procedure being documented is a "History and Physical" act. A ServiceEvent can further specialize
                                 the act inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, such as where the ClinicalDocument.code is simply "Procedure Report" and the
                                 procedure was a "colonoscopy". If ServiceEvent is included, it must be equivalent to or further specialize the value inherent
                                 in the ClinicalDocument.code, and shall not conflict with the value inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, as such a conflict
                                 would constitute an ambiguous situation.   
                              </p>
                              <p>ServiceEvent.effectiveTime can be used to indicate the time the actual event (as opposed to the encounter surrounding the
                                 event) took place.   
                              </p>
                              <p>The performer participant represents clinicians who actually and principally carry out the ServiceEvent. Performer.time can
                                 be used to specify the time during which the performer is involved in the activity. Performer.functionCode can be used to
                                 specify addition detail about the function of the performer (e.g. scrub nurse, third assistant).
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p><strong>Order: </strong>This class enables the representation of those orders being addressed by this document. For instance, a provider orders an
                                 X-Ray. The X-Ray is performed. A radiologist reads the X-Ray and generates a report. The X-Ray order identifier is transmitted
                                 in the Order class (Order.id), the performed X-Ray procedure is transmitted in the ServiceEvent clone, and the ClinicalDocument.code
                                 would be valued with "Diagnostic Imaging Report".
                              </p>

                              <p><strong>Consent: </strong>This class references the consents associated with this document. The type of consent (e.g. a consent to perform the related
                                 ServiceEvent, a consent for the information contained in the document to be released to a third party) is conveyed in Consent.code.
                                 Referenced consents are those that have been finalized (Consent.statusCode must equal "completed") and should be on file.
                                 The authorization.typeCode can be either "AUTH" (authorized by) or "REFR" (refers to). Use "AUTH" when the referenced consent
                                 is an authorization for the procedure or other act being documented. Use "REFR" for any other referenced consent.   
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p><strong>EncompassingEncounter: </strong>This class represents the clinical encounter during which the documented act occurred. Documents are not necessarily generated
                                 during an encounter, such as when a clinician, in response to an abnormal lab result, attempts to contact the patient but
                                 can't, and writes a Progress Note. 
                              </p>
                              <p>In some cases, the setting of the encounter is inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, such as where ClinicalDocument.code
                                 is "Diabetes Clinic Progress Note". The setting of an encounter can also be transmitted in the EncompassingEncounter.code
                                 or HealthCareFacility.code attribute. If either are sent, they should be equivalent to or further specialize the value inherent
                                 in the ClinicalDocument.code (such as where the ClinicalDocument.code is simply "Clinic Progress Note" and the value of HealthCareFacility.code
                                 is "cardiology clinic"), and shall not conflict with the value inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, as such a conflict would
                                 constitute an ambiguous situation. 
                              </p>
                              <p>EncompassingEncounter.effectiveTime represents the time of the encounter. EncompassingEncounter.dischargeDispositionCode can
                                 be used to depict the disposition of the patient at the time of hospital discharge (e.g., discharged to home, expired, against
                                 medical advice, etc.).   
                              </p>
                              <p>The location participant (location class) relates a healthcare facility (HealthCareFacility class) to the encounter to indicate
                                 where the encounter took place. The entity playing the role of HealthCareFacility is a place (Place class). The entity scoping
                                 the HealthCareFacility role is an organization (Organization class).          
                              </p>
                              <p>The setting of an encounter (e.g. cardiology clinic, primary care clinic, rehabilitation hospital, skilled nursing facility)
                                 can be expressed in HealthCareFacility.code. Note that setting (HealthCareFacility.code) and physical location (Place) are
                                 not the same. There is a many-to-many relationship between setting and the physical location where care is delivered. For
                                 instance, a particular place such as a room can provide the location for the cardiology clinic setting one day, and for the
                                 primary care clinic setting another day; and cardiology clinic today might be held in one place, but in another place tomorrow.
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p>The encounterParticipant participant represents clinicians directly associated with the encounter (e.g. by initiating, terminating,
                                 or overseeing it).

                                 the document. An example would be a resident physician who sees a patient and dictates a note, then later signs it. Authenticator.time
                                 reflects the time of authentication. Authenticator.signatureCode specifies whether and how the participant has attested his/her
                                 participation through a signature and or whether such a signature is needed.

                              <p><strong>recordTarget: </strong>The recordTarget represents the medical record that this document belongs to.   A clinical document typically has exactly
                                 one recordTarget participant. In the uncommon case where a clinical document (such as a group encounter note) is placed into
                                 more than one patient chart, more than one recordTarget participants can be stated.

                              <p>The <strong>subject</strong> participant represents the primary target of the observations recorded in the document. Most of the time the subject is the
                                 recordTarget, but need not be, for instance when the subject is a fetus observed in an obstetrical ultrasound. Therefore,
                                 there is both a recordTarget and a subject. To be explicit, both recordTarget and subject should be valued, even when redundant.
                                 When the subject is not included, it can be assumed that the subject is the recordTarget.

                        <p>Several participations can be played by the same person. In such cases, the person should be identified as the player for
                           each appropriate participation. For instance, if a person is both the author and the authenticator of a document, the message
                           should identify that person as both the author participant and the authenticator participant.  
                        </p>
                        <p>On other occasions, participants are played by different people. The following table shows a number of scenarios and the values
