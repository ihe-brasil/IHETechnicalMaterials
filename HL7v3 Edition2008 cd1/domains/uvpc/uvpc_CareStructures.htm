            <p><strong>4.0.1 Scope of Care Structures Topic</strong></p>
            <p>The Care Structures Topic defines the many UML class diagrams, called Care Structures, which model the information pertinent
               to the ongoing provision of care. These are described as local CMET's which are local to the Care Provision Domain. These
               local CMET's will be submitted to the pool of shared HL7 CMET's if these local CMET's pass ballot at the domain level. These
               CMET's or building blocks within the Care Provision Domain represent re-usable objects in larger model diagrams. This allows
               for a more efficient use of space when reviewing models on a screen.
            </p>
            <p>In many cases, these structures extend the basic assertion for responsibility of care by naming both concerns and care plans
               as components of the scope of responsibility. Care Structures represent the variable parts of a communication regarding the
               responsibility for Care Provision. As described in the scope of the Care Provision Domain, this care is provided to individuals,
               populations, and other targets of care, and communications with this information are designed to support the collaborations
               between care providers. This Care Structures Topic exists under the Care Provision Domain. For a full description of the domain
               and a discussion of the responsibility for care, please see the Care Provision Domain Overview. 
            </p>
            <p>The types of information modelled in Care Structures include</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Basic Care Statements, i.e. raw data with minimal summarization or interpretation, e.g. body weight, blood pressure, height</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Summary information created in lists, e.g. medication lists, surgery lists</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Judgment-related Care Statements, e.g. problem lists, allergy lists, diagnostic scales such as Depression scales, Barthel
                     index for Activities of Daily Living or risk for patient falls
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Care plans and their associated guideline definitions; what was completed and what has yet to be completed</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Concern Tracker to follow a problem of a patient over time, provider and location</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Statements about the situation of patient caretakers such as family members</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, the pertinent information included in an individual communication regarding patients is going to vary depending
               on the needs of the patient and the needs of the collaborating healthcare providers. The addition of Care Structures to messages
               at run-time allows messages to grow as needed.
            </p>
            <p>This Topic references the Clinical Statement Pattern Domain (a separate ballot pool from the Care Provision Domain) and guides
               readers on how to ballot specific Clinical Statement issues. Only Care Provision modifications of the Clinical Statement Pattern
               will be balloted through the Care Structures Topic. Specific Care Structures include the Concern Tracking Structure, the Care
               Plans/Guidelines Structure, and Assessment structures as well as the most important care structure, the Care Provision Domain
               version of the Clinical Statement choice box referred to in this Topic document as the Care Statement Structure.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4.0.2 Limits of Scope</strong></p>
            <p>The Care Structures are not intended to represent all the information communicated by systems that originate detailed pertinent
               information such as observation data or person registration data. The domains that support communication from these data generating
               systems tend to supply much more detail regarding the complex data context within which the data was generated. In that spirit,
               the intention of the Care Structures are to communicate the instance identifiers and meta data for these granular instances
               of data such that the receiving system has enough information to query sending systems for more detail on specific items of
               pertinent information (assuming the sending systems support queries and instance identifiers). However, other implementation
               specifications may extend this scope on Information Content to require more detail in the original communication and depend
               less on query and response methodologies. 
               
            </p>
            <p>These Care Structures may be further constrained for use in other Care Provision Domain topics and/or implementation guides
               from different committees and organizations external to HL7. It is NOT the intent that this Care Structures Topic describe
               all the possible constraints on these more general Care Structures.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4.0.3 Placement of Care Structures within the Care Provision Domain Model: </strong></p>
            <p>The structures to the right of the Care Provision Act are described in the following narrative:</p>
            <p><strong>4.0.3.1  Summary of Care Structures</strong></p>
            <p>The Care Structures topic is intended to provide a library of reusable and substitutable care structures derived from the
               Care Provision DMIM. Currently the topic provides only the core structures from which specific care structures such as Blood
               Pressure and Allergies can be derived. Some of these specific care structures are provided as informative examples:
            </p>
            <p>Normative Care Structures:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Care Statement     </li>
               <li>Composition Content     </li>
               <li>Statement Collector     </li>
               <li>Concern Tracking Structure    </li>
               <li>Care Provider     </li>
               <li>Care Target     </li>
               <li>Involved Person   </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Informative Care Structures:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Blood Pressure</li>
               <li>Heart Rate</li>
               <li>Weight</li>
               <li>Height</li>
               <li>Allergy</li>
               <li>Barthel Index</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>4.0.3.2 Local CMET's</strong></p>
            <p>The Care Structures presented within this section are provided as local CMET's (local to the Care Provision Domain). A Care
               Structure CMET uses the Common Message Element Type approach for representing reusable structures for use within the Care
               Provision Domain, which is derived from its DMIM. The CMET is used to represent these complex care structures that are used
               in multiple RMIMs. This simplifies the RMIM dramatically allowing the focus to be on the focal class and its association while
               supporting the substitution of constrained CMET for a universal CMET at either message design, implementation or creation
               time.
            </p>
            <p>The Care Plan, Involved Person, Care Provider and Care Target structures currently do not have further constrained models
               but have been provided as a Care structure for reuse purposes.
            </p>
            <p>An important concept in this Topic is the Hierarchy of Constraints on the abstract structures in the Care Provision DMIM.
               The Care Statement structure has been constrained to define the Concern Tracking Structure. The Composition Content structure
               is also a constraint on the Care Statement. Any of these constraints can be substituted for the Care Statement which is associated
               with the Care Plan and Statement Collector structures, and the Care Provision Act. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>4.0.3.3 Clinical Statement Pattern</strong></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, the ballot pool for this document focuses on the extensions and constraints that the Care Provision Domain
               has applied to the Clinical Statement Pattern. These extensions or constraints will be clearly identified in the narrative
               on each care structure. Ballot issues related to the Clinical Statement Pattern itself should be directed to the Clinical
               Statement Pattern ballot pool. For contrast, the Clinical Statement Definition is compared to the Care Statement Definition.
               
            </p>
            <p><strong>Clinical Statement Definition (to be balloted in the Clinical Statement Pattern ballot pool)</strong></p>
            <p>The formal definition of clinical statement for the care of patients is:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p><em>An expression of a discrete item of clinical (or clinically related) information that is recorded because of its relevance
                     to the care of a patient."</em></p>
               <p>Clinical information is fractal in nature and therefore the extent and detail conveyed in a single statement may vary.</p>
               <p>To be regarded as a clinical statement, a concept must be associated with a patient in a manner which makes clear:</p>
               <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                  <li>Its temporal context</li>
                  <li>Its relationship to the patient</li>
                  <li>In the case of an observation: its mood and presence, absence or value</li>
                  <li>In the case of a procedure:its mood and status</li>
               </ul>
               <p>This clarity may be achieved by:</p>
               <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                  <li>Explicit representation; or</li>
                  <li>Implicit application of defaults ONLY where explicitly modeled rules state the appropriate default</li>
               </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The Clinical Statement Pattern is a generalized HL7 abstract pattern used in multiple HL7 domain message information models
               that provides basic data about the target of care. This HL7 Pattern may be constrained, extended, or left unchanged by HL7
               Technical Committees, which use this pattern in the definition of a domain.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4.0.3.4 Care Statement Structure</strong></p>
            <p>As you refer back to the Clinical Statement Pattern, you will see that there are no major differences between it and the Care
               Statement Structure seen below.
            </p><a class="">REPC_RM000100</a><p><strong>4.0.3.4.1 Extensions on the Clinical Statement Pattern Domain</strong></p>
            <p>The Clinical Statement Pattern is renamed the Care Statement Structure in this Care Structure Topic in order to emphasize
               that Care may apply to medical devices, facilities, and environmental sites as well as patients. In that sense, the vocabulary
               used to support Care Statements is more extensive than the vocabulary used to support simply the care of patients. These extensions
               will be documented by a gradual increase in the number and variety of HL7 vocabulary value sets. 
               
            </p>
            <p>The intention is that a care statement instance may be added by itself to the Care Provision Act at creation of the RMIM or
               added at run-time execution of an application in order to support the variability of extent and detail described in the clinical
               statement definition above. Of course, the care statement may be added to the Care Provision Act along with adding the other
               structures of the Care Provision Domain as well.
            </p>
            <p>The extension of clinical statement to care statement extends the definition of care statement to:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p> An expression of a discrete item of care-related information that is recorded because of its relevance to the care of a target
                  of care. Care information is fractal in nature and therefore the extent and detail conveyed in a single statement may vary.
               </p>
               <p>To be regarded as a care statement, a concept must be associated with a target of care in a manner which makes clear:</p>
               <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                  <li>Its temporal context</li>
                  <li>Its relationship to the target of care</li>
                  <li>In the case of an observation: its mood and presence, absence or value</li>
                  <li>In the case of a procedure: its mood and status</li>
               </ul>
               <p>This clarity may be achieved by</p>
               <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                  <li>Explicit representation; or</li>
                  <li>Implicit application of defaults ONLY where explicitly modelled rules state the appropriate defaults.</li>
               </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The reader should refer to the documentation for the HL7 Reference Information Model for a complete set of attribute descriptions
               for each class in the Care Statement Structure.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4.0.3.4.2 Constraints on the Clinical Statement Pattern Domain:</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>The multiplicity on Clinical Statement ActChoice Act identifiers is published in the Pattern as (0*), which is constrained
                  in Care Statement Act identifiers to (1*). The reason for this important constraint is that the extensive use of ActReference
                  and queries in the Care Provision Domain depends on the existence of instance identifiers. These instance identifiers normally
                  have been generated by the system authoring the instance. However, many instance identifier strategies exist and the only
                  assumption in this constraint is that an instance identifier uniquely identifies the instance in systems to be queried. Instances
                  may be privately communicated from an originating system to a receiving system or interface engine which adds unique system
                  identifiers and then re-sends the instances out to other systems. In this case, the original system cannot be queried. Only
                  the systems that have generated or received unique instance identifiers can be queried. 
                  
               </li>
               <li>Two constraints are added to specific Care Structures classes from the Infrastructure Root Class: InfrastructureRoot.realmCode;
                  InfrastructureRoot.templateID. These constraints are intended to be used in Care Structures in the same way they are used
                  in CDA Release 2 documents. That is, until more specific HL7 methods are agreed upon for templates, the template ID refers
                  to a unique specification guide within a Care Provision Topic. The realmCode is then used to further constrain a template
                  ID, giving different realms the ability to leverage a specific template in a unique way (especially by additional constraints
                  on vocabulary usage). All of the Classes in the Care Statement include the templateId and realmCode attributes. 
                  
               </li>
               <li>Care Structure Constraints: The Clinical Statement Pattern is very general and allows all clinical Statements (or in the case
                  of this Topic, the "Care Statements) to be represented from recursions on the ClinicalStatement choice. However, in the Care
                  Structure Topic, as a Care Structure derived from the Care Statement Pattern is unrolled and defined, the Care Statement is
                  constrained from representing that same structure in the same RMIM. In other words, in the same RMIM, one must not represent
                  concern events both in the Concern Tracking Structure and from Concern Acts constructed from the CareStatement. Therefore,
                  the following Care Structures each act as a constraint on the Care Statement when the derived Care Structure and the Care
                  Statement are used in the same RMIM. 
                  
               </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Over time, the Care Structures Topic will include additional Care Structures that may be used by specific realms for specific
               purposes with specific constraints on vocabulary through the use of the HL7 attributes, InfrastructureRoot.templateId and
               InfrastructureRoot.realmCode. In this way, constraints will be explicitly defined in both the unrolled portions of the structure
               and the remaining, constrained, Care Statement portion of the structure. Consequently, when the publication of templates is
               defined, many Care Structures published in this document may be re-classified and published as templates instead.
            </p>
            <p>In the following section, the RMIM's for the specific Care Structures will be described. They will be described first in a
               "clinically relevant manner" in a general narrative. Following the general clinical narrative, there will be a formal walk-thru
               developed as found in a typical engineering specification. Not all of the formal walk-thru's have been completed for this
               ballot.

                        <p>
                           Assessment scales are becoming more and more common in healthcare. For many years, the APGAR scale has been used to evaluate
                           a newborn immediately after birth. Another example is the Barthel index, used mostly by nursing. The aim of the Barthel Index
                           is to be able to capture and follow the level of help required by the patient in the performance of activities of daily life.
                           (Mahoney Barthel, 1965) 
                           1 
                           . The scientific validation for the Netherlands was carried out by de Haan et al (1993) 
                           2 
                           . It appears that the Dutch version of the scale is valid and reliable for individual use and for use in populations (epidemiological
                           research), as a measure of outcome, for example. There are realm specific differences in the original English and the translated
                           Dutch version of the scale, e.g. the value sets differ. The total score of the index depends on individual component scores
                           on ten variables. 
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>The model for the Barthel Index starts with the naming on top (entry-point), with the name Barthel_Index. Beneath that is
                           the act type Observation(OBS) with the name Barthel_Index. This is the central OBS for this model. In this act the total score
                           of the Barthel Index is shown. The class Barthel Index has class code = OBS. Furthermore, the field for code system should
                           be filled with the Barthel Index. In the derivation code the total score for the Barthel Index is recorded. In other words:
                           derivation method = add all values of the separate variables. Effective time is the point in time on which the Barthel Index
                           is scored. In the value, which was created by adding the individual variables, is filled up. This is always an INT data type
                           because it is mandatory to score and fill up all items to get a proper sum score. That is why Mandatory (1..1). Interpretationshows
                           how the total score should be interpreted. This is 0-9 for seriously limited, 10-19 for moderately limited and 20 for independent.
                        </p>
                        <p>The OBS Barthel_Index contains ten variables itself, which each contain another OBS. These are bowels, bladder, grooming,
                           toilet use, feeding, transfers, mobility, dressing, stairs and bathing respectively. For each of them the scoring options
                           of 0 up to 3 are given in the field ObservationMethod. The result of the score comes in to the field value. For all OBS the
                           time can be recorded in effective time. In codea unique code is given for the concerning variable. In earlier versions ICF
                           codes were used, however, these cause too much confusion with other similar observations of the patient one wants to record.

                        </table><strong>Concern Tracking Structure Overview:</strong><p>One particular feature of the Care Provision models and messages is the possibility to track the condition of the patient
                           / target across time, providers and locations. In order to allow this within the mechanics of the HL7 v3 messaging, the Concern
                           Act class is introduced and fully explained in this Concern Tracking Topic area of this ballot. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The Concern Tracking Structure supports the expression of concerns about situations pertaining to selected entities that are
                           the target or subject of care. It organizes basic clinical data into a longitudinal data structure, which supports tracking
                           and management of complex processes over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>Definition of Concern Class as result of harmonization work:  An interest or focus of attention that tends to persist over
                           time and has as a subject a state or process.  The subject of the interest or focus of attention has the potential to require
                           intervention or management.  
                        </p>
                        <p>Concern tracking is used to implement the problem-oriented medical record concept introduced by Larry Weed in the 1960's and
                           1970's. For engineers, the problem-oriented medical record can be considered a health care version of industrial project management
                           processes that focus on issue resolution. The intention of this model is to support both the tracking of these concerns at
                           the "high-level" as well as the detailed tracking of complex management processes at the "low-level." The decision on whether
                           to track concerns at the high-level or low-level is to be an application-dependent decision. Applications may use techniques
                           described in this section to track concerns but are not required at this level of the specification to include all the tracking
                           information. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Examples of use for the Concern Class include but are not limited to: an observation result in form of a diagnosis e.g. a
                           patient having cancer which gives the concern a name, a procedure such as amputation of the left leg requiring care management,
                           a substance administration, e.g. receiving cytotoxic drugs requiring extra management, equipment repair status, device recall
                           status, a health risk, a financial risk, public health risk, pregnancy, disease, complaint. In particular this concern class
                           is used to group information about, or to follow up on, a specific episode of care, or a care need or patient problem, especially
                           if more than one provider is involved in the care. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In the usual course of presentation, diagnosis, and treatment, the caretaker of a concern gains a gradually better understanding
                           of the concern.  An example of a concern in the disease management area is the Episode of Illness.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>In a typical clinical scenario, the patient presents to the clinician with the "chief complaint." This chief complaint or
                           chief concern is one of many symptoms that represent the patient's view of the primary problem from which the patient is suffering.
                           Multiple questions and exams are performed on the patient, which provides a data set from which a clinician may develop a
                           viewpoint on the concern (the abductive or "hypothesis generating" phase of the process as described by Peirce). On the basis
                           of this initial understanding of the concern, tests are ordered and observations carried out by the clinician and time passes.
                           Frequently, the disease evolves and demonstrates more symptoms and signs. At each point in time during multiple contacts with
                           the patient or with patient data, the clinician has evolved a set of potential diagnoses. In addition, during each point in
                           time, various treatments may be recommended by the clinician, citing the concern as the reason for the various treatments.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>One business need filled by the Concern Tracking Structure is to support the direct care of the patient with an organized
                           model for representing multiple contacts with the subject of care while the concern is evolving, data is being collected,
                           and treatments are being applied. In addition, the business needs of quality improvement and cost accounting performed by
                           data mining applications are supported by tracking the evaluation and management actions associated with the concern.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus the concern class can function as a grouper for all activities associated with a specific patient-related problem. The
                           problem can, due to different observations, evolve over time and can be tracked or managed by one or more care professionals.
                           Different professionals may have different opinions of the nature of the problem, but all their observations are grouped under
                           the same concern.   So essentially, the concern class is used to track what affects the patient. It is independent of the
                           assigned profession, and can have different personal diagnoses attached. It is what ties all underlying activities (Acts)
                           together. See figure 1 for how some of these concerns can relate to each other:  
                        </p>

                        <p>In the discussion that follows, the Concern Tracking Structure will be divided into four levels of function that support communications
                           at differing levels of detail. These four levels of function include: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The attention for the Concern itself, i.e. the subject(s) of concern</li>
                           <li>Adding additional contextual information to the concern, i.e. references to additional relevant Care Statements</li>
                           <li>Using attention for a Concern to justify additional management, i.e. Concern as "Reason for an intervention"</li>
                           <li>Establishing associations with past instances of Concern in order to fully represent the Episode of Illness </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Guidance:</strong> In HL7, the Observation Class is used to communicate the perception of a state or process.  These are linked together under
                           a concern.  In the RIM, the term Act always represents a record regarding the process of doing. Observation represents a constraint
                           on the definition of Act that takes the form: the Act of Observation where Observation is the noun form of the infinitive
                           "to observe." Therefore, the Act of Observation is also the recording of a process. In addition, Observation may need to be
                           constrained further with various Act.code values in order to narrow the definition of the Act of Observation to various types
                           of observation processes. 
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>The "Attention" for a Concern is simply the idea or hypothesis that one of many potential states or processes may potentially
                           require extra attention and management. The specific item or items of concern is represented as the "Subject or Subjects of
                           Concern. At least one subject of concern must be present in a Concern Tracking Structure. In some implementation guides, the
                           Subject Act Relationship may be constrained to one or a few subjects rather than a large or infinite number of subjects. All
                           subjects of concern should be considered as a single cluster or focus of concern. A patient may have multiple concerns identified,
                           each with a collection of subjects.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>In healthcare, the concern for the medical device, home of the patient, or other non-living subjects may need to be managed
                           as well as the concern for the patients' bodies and wellbeing themselves. Accordingly, "concern " in this discussion is meant
                           to be a general term referring to state of being of any entity. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The key characteristics of this Concern Act class are that it allows to link different stages in the condition of the patient
                           / target in the following ways:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>It might be possible that one patient has two different concerns that normally are unrelated; however, there might be interactions.
                              Example: a patient with diabetes that has an accident and breaks a leg. It is not due to any diabetes related problem. Thus
                              there will be two separate concern trackers: one for the diabetes care, another for the treatment of the fracture. Basically
                              from the Concern Act point of view these are unrelated. In terms of instantiation of classes: the Concern Act is instantiated
                              one time for diabetes and will get an unique class ID, and the Concern Act is instantiated a second time for the fracture
                              and gets another - different - class ID. 
                           </li>
                           <li> It might occur that a patient has a concern and within the care for that, there is a sub-concern, requiring special attention,
                              related to the top-level concern. For instance a woman being pregnant (the top-level concern) who has high blood pressure
                              (the sub-concern).  A similar example would be the Concern 'Obesities' for a patient and related to this the sub concern of
                              (risk for) Diabetes type II. We apply the Component Act relationship in the Concern Tracker structure for this.   In addition,
                              a use case frequently occurring is to refer to a fetus' observations, e.g. fetal heart rate, but it goes in the record and
                              messages of the pregnant woman. In that instance, the Condition of mother (patient) is pregnant, which must be linked to the
                              sub Condition of fetus is 'unborn' and the underlying observation of the fetal heart rate.     In the COMP actRelationship,
                              the Id of the 'Concern' and that of the 'sub-Concern' are separate and independent, and simply linked in a parent-child actRelationship.
                              
                           </li>
                           <li>Some concerns exist during a period, go away for a while and come back later. Basically the concern is intermittent in nature,
                              although the concern-related observations and diagnoses of the patient might change over time. Examples include the exacerbation
                              of COPD, or the 'winter blues'. We can apply the Sequel (SEQL) Act Relationship for this kind of linkage between concerns.
                              Also this relationship is typically used to refer to an earlier pregnancy (Concern 1) during a current pregnancy (Concern
                              2). The concern ID's differ, but tackle a similar concern. In addition, the naming (Annotation) or underpinning (Observations)
                              can have the same names, or values. 
                           </li>
                           <li> A concern might be the situation of the patient that evolves over time and about which different providers involved (including
                              the patient him/herself) have matured their insight. For example a patient talking about chest pain, a general practitioner
                              thinking about a cardiac problem, and the cardiologist diagnosing a myocardial infarction. In particular relevant is also
                              the example of episodes of pregnancy, delivery and maternity. ELNK is intended to link different parts (episodes or periods,
                              sometimes with different care providers and care provisions) of the same concern: e.g., link pregnancy to delivery and to
                              maternity.    The concern tracker structure allows grouping of observations, procedures, encounters, and other acts for the
                              particular concern, and this grouping can contain different diagnoses of different providers, all associated with the same
                              concern. Thus, the concern is a patient-related grouper, which can be used throughout the whole care provision if the care
                              is carried out by one professional, or to several care provisions if the care is performed by several professionals. In the
                              above example the general practitioner has provided care and probably referred the patient to the cardiologist. The cardiologist
                              starts his Care Provision but this can be grouped under the same concern. The test results obtained by the Cardiologist also
                              go under this concern, thus maturing the insight in the problem the patient has.   This can be dealt with using the ELINK
                              Episode link Act Relationship, where the id for the concern class remains the same over time, but the Act ids for the different
                              episodes (patient himself, general practitioner, cardiologist) can differ.     In the ELINK actRelationship, each Concern'
                              has a separate and unique identifier. 
                           </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In particular two options: the merge and split of acts are relevant here. It might be that initially two concerns have been
                           treated as separate instances, but need to merge into one concern. For example, evolving insights might lead to the conclusion
                           that one was a symptom concern of the other being a disease concern. In such example the symptom concern can be grouped under
                           the disease concern by replacing the ID of the symptom concern with the one of the disease concern. This can be done with
                           the ELINK relationship  Similarly, if two interest, initially grouped under the same Concern (with the same ID), appear to
                           be independent of each other, then the two concerns can be split, where best is to give each a new instance identifier, or
                           allow one concern to be continued under the same concern ID, and the split concern getting a new ID. This is dealt with using
                           the Replace relationship.   
                        </p>
                        <p>These four linkage types: Component, Sequel, Episode Link and Replace are considered the use cases that are dealt with in
                           detail in this Concern Tracking Topic. Further, there is an explanatory document attached to the Care Provision ballot materials
                           covering much more detail and examples.

                           Choice Box (represented here as A_CareStatement CMET) allows the clinician to identify additional Care Statements that may
                           be relevant to the "context of the Concern," but which cannot be truly classified as subjects of the concern. A normal lab
                           result is an example. This "Reference ActRelationship" is especially helpful in communicating the context of the concern during
                           the initial identification of the concern, i.e. the abductive or "hypothesis-generating" phase. Occasionally, "Reference"
                           may be used to add important contextual information to the Concern as the understanding about the concern evolves.

                        <p><strong>Reasons for Management Actions:</strong>
                           	The "Reason ActRelationship" is used to cite the Concern as the reason for the management action. After the nature of the
                           Concern is established by utilizing the Subject and Reference ActRelationships, most ActRelationships associated with Concern
                           will be used to justify the services generated to address or manage the Concern. This ActRelationship is the "Reason ActRelationship"
                           from Care Statements back to the instance of Concern itself.

                        <p><strong>Extending and Clarifying the Episode of Illness:</strong>
                           	Finally, there may be a need to identify associations to other instances of the same concern. For example, after treating
                           a concern for a period of time, a physician may discover that another physician has been treating the same concern in another
                           institution. In this case, the first physician may wish to simply link his concern to the other physician's concern, i.e.
                           using "EpisodeLink ActRelationship;" or he may wish to ask the other physician to obsolete the other physician's concern using
                           the "Replace ActRelationship."
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Updating the Concern Tracking Structure:</strong> Note that the specific use cases and recommendations for update semantics and instance management in general are still being
                           developed by M&amp;M.   Consequently, specific guidance regarding the use or change of the Replace and EpisodeLink ActRelationships
                           may evolve as HL7 as a whole nails down the details of instance management.

                        <p><strong>Care Statement Structure Overview:  </strong></p>
                        <p>The Care Statement Structure assists in collecting clinical information that can be documented during care provision. The
                           choice box allows expressing any collection of statements about care in any order or number, and in any kind of combination,
                           depending on the purpose and nature of the message.   
                        </p>
                        <p>The Care Statement Structure is the model from which all other Care Structures are derived. This derivation occurs by constraint.
                           Based on the Clinical Statement Pattern, it is renamed the Care Statement Structure in this Domain Message Information Model
                           for Care Provision in order to emphasize that Care may apply to medical devices, facilities, and environmental sites as well
                           as patients. In that sense, the vocabulary used to support Care Statements is more extensive than the vocabulary used to support
                           simply the care of patients. These extensions will be documented by a gradual increase in the number and variety of HL7 vocabulary
                           value sets.  This description does not replicate the full details of the Clinical Statement Pattern but documents those aspects
                           that differ significantly from the base pattern.
                        </p>
                        <p>The intention is that a care statement instance may be added by itself to the Care Provision Act at creation of the RMIM or
                           added at runtime execution of an application in order to support the variability of extent and detail described in the care
                           statement definition above. Of course, the care statement may be added to the Care Provision Act along with adding the other
                           structures of the Care Provision Domain as well.   
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Use of the model</strong></p>
                        <p>The Care Statement model represents a standard, high-level structure for the inclusion of clinical information in Care Provision
                           communications intended to support specific business functions. Although not intended to be implemented 'as is', the Care
                           Statement model can be constrained to meet the requirements of many specific communications regarding clinical information.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>Options for pattern constraint include: </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The generic 'Care Statement' class attributes may be constrained to reflect the precise nature of the data to be conveyed.
                              For example: 
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Optional attributes may be removed if not appropriate to the business case.</li>
                                 <li>Attributes themselves may be constrained: 
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>multiplicities may be constrained to narrower number sets, e.g. (0..*) may be constrained to (1..*)  </li>
                                       <li>attribute value sets may be constrained to smaller attribute value sets, e.g. 'mood code' limited to 'Event' </li>
                                    </ul>
                                 </li>
                                 <li>Data types for an attribute may be constrained, e.g. 'ANY to CD' </li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                           <li>Associations may be constrained to remove the potential for complexity, e.g. the limitation of an implementation to three
                              levels of nesting; the removal of 'Episode Link' in order to define an implementation to the 'lowest common denominator' regarding
                              system capabilities 
                           </li>
                           <li>Classes may be constrained: 
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Classes may be removed if not required </li>
                                 <li>Classes may be constrained to specific subclasses, e.g. 'Observation Class' constrained to 'Vital signs Class'</li>
                                 <li>Classes may be 'cloned' in order to document specific constraints on attributes or associations. </li>
                                 <li>Classes with specific constraints applied may be 'unrolled' from the Clinical Statement Choice box in order to constrain their
                                    use to a specific structure (in that case, the constrained version of the class may no longer be assumed to be present in
                                    the generalized Care Statement Choice Box)  
                                 </li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Classes may be combined into specific clinical artifacts, such as combined observations in case of blood pressure or clinical
                              scales such as Apgar score and Barthel index.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This model is referenced by an Act external to the Care Statements. Often, this external Act provides the 'Entry point' to
                           a communication specification and represents the context in which the care statement information is being sent. For example,
                           the information regarding who is sending this information is found in an Act external to the Care Statements. The Care Provision
                           Act in the Care Provision Domain is an example of an Act external to the Care Statement.

                        <p><strong>Care Statement Model  (REPC_RM000100)</strong></p><strong>Description</strong><p><strong>Model Overview </strong></p>
                        <p>The model can be divided into 3 related parts:  * CareEntry Choice Box  * Participations surrounding the Acts  * Acts outside
                           the CareEntry Choice Box  
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>CareEntry Choice Box</strong></p>
                        <p>This part of the model is used to convey the detailed care statements that are being sent in support of the specific business
                           need. As well as providing a mechanism for conveying the components of this information, it supports grouping of these components
                           and provides mechanisms to explicitly link statements where there is a specific relationship. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The class clones in the CareEntry choice are the same as those available in the Clinical Statement Pattern ActChoice. Class
                           clone names and all aspects of the attributes are identical.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Linking of Statements</strong></p>
                        <p>The modeling of the linking of Care Statements has been modified from that in the Clinical Statement Pattern as follows: </p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>The sourceOf / targetOf relationship has been unwrapped into 2 separate relationships: sourceOf and targetOf.</li>
                           <li>The target of the new sourceOf relationship is the outer CareStatement choice</li>
                           <li> sourceOf1 has been removed </li>
                           <li>A constraint has been added to the new sourceOf relationship stating that the value of contextConductionInd must be "false"
                              if the target is an ActReference (context cannot be conducted to ActReferences) 
                           </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        
                        
                        This revised modeling approach provides the same semantics as that in the Clinical Statement Pattern but is considered to
                        be a less complicated approach. 
                        <p><strong>Record Target and Subject</strong></p>
                        
                        
                        
                        As well as applying to a patient, a Care Statement can also apply to a variety of other types of entity (eg. Equipment). 
                        To support this, the target of the RecordTarget participation is a choice of the R_CarePatient and R_CaredEntity CMETs.  
                        <p>Similarly, the subject of a Care Statement can be any one of several types of entity including:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li> the patient</li>
                           <li>another person </li>
                           <li>a specimen</li>
                           <li>a device</li>
                           <li>a facility </li>
                           <li>an environmental site</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An extended set of roles in the SubjectChoice that is the target of the subject participation supports this requirement. 
                           
                        </p><em><strong>consumable  </strong></em><p>The consumable participation is used to bring in the Consumable Choice. This can be a Manufactured Product role (played by
                           a Labelled Drug or a Material) or an Instance of Kind role (played by a Material Kind that can itself be specified as part
                           of a larger whole).

                        <p><strong>Statement Collector Structure </strong></p>
                        <p>The Statement Collector Structure is intended to support various methods of organizing Care Statements. A minimum of semantic
                           information is implied by each organizing structure. However, the implications of these minimal semantics are very important
                           to the policies and procedures of many organizations which may use templateId and realmCode attributes to specify additional
                           semantics.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Statement Collector is a choice of collector Acts, ActList and ActCategory. The Component (COMP) Act Relationship is used
                           to group Care Statements into working lists and category lists created for specific purposes and applications. The structure
                           can represent any kind of list or grouping used in Patient Care, e.g. problems, medications, allergies, observations, activities,
                           encounters,  and variances.  Each collector Act may have an Author. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>ActList </strong></p>
                        <p>The ActList is a clone of the WorkingList Act, which has the following definition:</p>
                        <p>"A dynamic list of individual instances of Act which reflects the needs of an individual worker, team of workers, or an organization
                           to view groups of Acts for clinical and administrative reasons." Examples include problem lists, goal lists, allergy lists,
                           and to-do lists. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The ActList represents the myriad of dynamic or managed lists found in clinical summaries such as concern lists (e.g. problem
                           lists or allergy lists), medication lists, surgery lists, etc. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The most common uses of working lists include lists managed at the departmental level. For example, it is common in many hospital
                           organizations for the pharmacy department to create the medication list that is used for formal medication interaction applications
                           when a new medication is added to the list. Another example of a departmental working list is the episode of care defined
                           by the cost accounting department for analysis of the costs related to encounters that include a specific diagnosis. In this
                           case, the ActList collects encounters that include Act Relationships to the specific concern. 
                        </p><em>ActList Attributes</em><p><strong>classCode:</strong> The mandatory classCode is specified as LIST (working list), a specialization of the Act class.    
                        </p><strong>moodCode:</strong> The mandatory moodCode used in ActList is always EVN (event). 
                        <p><strong>code: </strong>This required attribute describes a kind of WorkingList. The ActListCode vocabulary domain provides a small set of coded values
                           but this attribute allows extensions to this value set.  
                        </p>

                        <p>The formal definition of Category, which is a subclass of Organizer, is:</p>
                        <p>A group of entries within a composition or topic that have a common characteristic for example, Examination, Diagnosis, Management
                           or Subjective, Objective, Analysis, Plan (SOAP).  
                        </p>
                        <p>The distinction from Topic, another subclass of Organizer relates to value sets. For Category there is a bounded list of things
                           like "Examination", "Diagnosis" or SOAP categories. For Topic the list is wide open to any clinical concern or reason for
                           a part of an encounter.   
                        </p>
                        <p>The ActCategory allows Care Statements to be classified externally to the Care Statement. For example, a particular template
                           for a summary report may require the inclusion of data within specific, required categories. This external classification
                           scheme for clinical statements supports that requirement. This mechanism allows a positive statement that "there is no content
                           for this classification" within the pertinent information of Care Provision.     
                        </p><em>ActCategory Attributes</em><p><strong>classCode:</strong> The mandatory classCode is specified as CATEGORY, a specialization of the Organizer class under the abstract ActClassContainer
                           sub-domain.

                        <p>Typically, "vital signs" represent a collection of individual findings, each of which include a reference range. This reference
                           range may be specific for the age or gender of the patient or other "patient criteria." In addition, the vital signs may be
                           qualified by a specific state the patient is in, e.g. actively exercising; at rest; etc. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In this RMIM, the focal class identifies the entire collection of vital signs. The vital signs are taken after the state of
                           the patient is noted, as indicated by the "startsAfterStartOf" ActRelationship. Finally, the component vital signs, the respective
                           reference range for each vital sign, and the criterion for each reference range is represented by the remaining classes.
