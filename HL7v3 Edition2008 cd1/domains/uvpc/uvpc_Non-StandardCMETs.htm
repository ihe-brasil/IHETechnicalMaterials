            <p>This domain uses "internal" CMETs (as opposed to the universal COCT variety) to provide reuse of model elements within the
               domain.  In the current DSTU release, there are two of these internal CMETs that are not yet normative (or DSTU), but which
               are included as references in designs that are part of the DSTU.  This topic serves as the place-holder for these two CMETs.

                        </table><strong>Care Plan Structure Overview: </strong><p>Among the most important Care Structures in the Care Provision Domain is the Care Plan Structure. The purpose of this structure
                           is to define the management action plans for the various conditions identified for the target of care. It is the structure
                           in which the care planning for all individual professions or for groups of professionals can be organized, planned and checked
                           for completion. Communicating explicitly documented and planned actions and goals greatly aids the team in understanding and
                           coordinating the actions that need to be performed for the person. Care plans also permit the monitoring and flagging of unperformed
                           activities and unmet goals for later follow up.

                        The term Patient Care Planning in MESH is described as:
                        <p>Usually a written medical and nursing care program designed for a particular patient. Year introduced: 1968"</p>
                        <p>The basic theory underlying this structure comes from Larry Weeds Problem-oriented Medical Record, also introduced in the
                           1960s, which is used by many health professions and electronic health record systems as a primary method for organizing work
                           and documentation.
                        </p><strong>Phases of Care Plans and Guidelines: </strong>Essential to many Care Plans and Guidelines is the concept of sequential "Phases" or stages. These phases of the Care Plan
                        are to be modeled using recursive component ActRelationship on the focal act of Care Provision. Each component phase is then
                        considered a mini-guideline or mini-care plan. Typical phases include those defined by nursing practice, e.g. assessment,
                        plan, performance and evaluation; or those defined by organizational practice, e.g. pre-operative, operative, post-operative
                        recovery, post-operative rehabilitation, etc. (see Figure 1) The decision support tools discussed below govern entrance and
                        exit logic from these mini-guidelines and care plans. 
                        <p>Figure 1 The Care Plan builds upon the collection of Observations that are expressed in the Care Statement structure and usually
                           are organized in the Statement Collector, both structures of the Care Provision D-MIM. Following one to many observations
                           a clinician will determine a diagnoses and from there can set outcomes, define care activities and implement these. Outcomes
                           can be observed at any point during the care.

                        <p>Figure 2. Figure 2 below describes the dynamics of the care process, which is usually documented in the care record. To support
                           the documentation of each of the components of the care process and to facilitate the exchange of data, the HL7 v3 Care Plan
                           structure REPC_RM000200 has been developed.

                        </p><strong>  Scope of Responsibility: </strong><p>The Care Provision Structure is attached to the Care Provision Act in two ways. As components of the Care Provision Act, the
                           Care Plans reflect part of the scope of responsibility (a component of the care delivery) defined by the Care Provision Act
                           (see the Care Provision Domain narrative). Component is more specific than pertinent. It says that one act is part of another
                           act. In this case, planning for future care is "part of" the delivery of care, which is the focal class. As pertinent information
                           to the Care Provision Act, the Care Plans are used by the receiver to make sure that orders are checked for interactions and
                           not duplicated or mistakenly discontinued by the receiver.

                        For example, if a request is made to a receiver to answer a particular question on the care of a particular disease, that
                        question may be expressed within a Care Plan request. A particular question may be asked of the receiver of the request to
                        fill in the observation.value field and/or the observation.text field or other relevant fields in an instance of observation.
                        To further illustrate this example; the patient may have a cardiac valve replacement and be anti-coagulated on coumadin. The
                        patient may also be pregnant, which is noted as pertinent information. A cardiologist may be asked for the highest acceptable
                        Protime INR value that would limit bleeding in the pregnancy but still give protection for the valve replacement. In this
                        case, the component care plan would identify the cardiac valve replacement as the reason for the care plan. The Care Plan
                        Class instance would be in request mood. The observation.mood would be goal request; the observation.code would code the Protime
                        test; and, as in all requests, the values for the acceptable INR range are not included, indicating that they should be filled
                        in by the cardiologist (see Table 1).   
                        <p>Table 1:  Attribute values for class instances in Care Plan Request</p>
                        <p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/REPC_NA000043.gif" alt="REPC_NA000043.gif" /><br /></p>
                        <p>In addition, the cardiologist may add a schedule of protime tests in proposal mood to the care plan and include recommended
                           medication adjustments for the various INR values that might be obtained from the protime measurements (see the section on
                           Decision Support below). 
                        </p><strong>Moods and States of Care Plans and Guidelines: </strong>The difference between the Guideline Class and the Care Plan Class is the difference in concept between a Guideline, which
                        is "a general list of actions that are defined to be applied to all appropriate targets of care when certain pre-conditions
                        are met" versus the Care Plan, which is "the specific list of actions that are intended to be applied to a specific target
                        of care." Therefore, the mood code of Guidelines is Definition Mood, and the mood code of Care Plans is Intent Mood and its
                        children moods (See table 2). 
                        <p>Table 2: Children of Intent Mood (link to ActMood file in RIM) </p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/REPC_NA000044.gif" alt="REPC_NA000044.gif" /><br /><p>A Request would be used to ask a consultant to recommend a care plan. Proposal would be used by a consultant recommending
                           a Care Plan. Intent itself would be used to activate a care plan. Care plans may be scheduled in Appointment mood. For each
                           mood, several states are valid, in particular the states of "active" and "completed. The one or more care plan instances in
                           a given communication potentially contain any acts included in the Care Statement Structure.

                        Typically, a specific Care Plan will have actions added or taken away from the list of actions in a Guideline, often referred
                        to as Care Plan variations. In relationship to clinical pathways, such variations are normally documented in order to measure
                        the variances on populations of patients, which can be used to improve the guidelines. For the purpose of clarity within the
                        Care Plan Structure, variation is defined here as something that is different from a standard (i.e., the Guideline), where
                        variance is a statistical measure of dispersion, or a calculated degree of variation (How much does this patient differ compared
                        to a group of similar patients). Of course the reasons for these Care Plan variations include the presence of co-morbidities,
                        judgments of the clinician, non-consent of a patient, and other reasons described in the disease management literature.  
                        
                        <p>Often, in a Care Provision communication, the Guideline is named simply as a reference to an external guideline without specifically
                           representing all the Care Statements implied by the Guideline. However, other business needs may require that all the Care
                           Statements that exist in a specific Guideline definition be specifically communicated as well. It should go without saying
                           that in a Care Provision communication, the Care Statements collected by a Guideline need to be kept completely separate for
                           patient safety reasons from Care Statements collected by a Care Plan. However, it is important to be able to document the
                           variation between what the Guideline (in Definition Mood) states should be done, and what according to the Care Statements
                           has actually been done (Any Act in Event Mood). In the Care Plan RMIM, what "has been done" is documented in the "fulfillment"
                           ActRelationship from Care Statements CMET to the Care Plan choice box.
                        </p><strong>Additional Classes:</strong> Participations follow the general model for Care Provision Domain as a whole. Reason for the Care Plan is represented by
                        the Reason ActRelationship associated to the disease Condition. Goals and the other Predicate moods (Event.Criterion and Option)
                        may be applied to the whole care plan as well as to component phases of the care plan (see Table 3). 
                        <p><strong>Table 3: Predicate Moods (link to ActMood file in RIM)</strong></p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/REPC_NA000045.gif" alt="REPC_NA000045.gif" /><br /><p><strong>Moods and States of Care Plan Components: </strong>As mentioned above, Care Plans are collectors of Care Statements. Like the Care Plan itself, these Care Statements collected
                           by the Care Plan will have moods of either Intent or the children of Intent. However, like any Care Statements in the Intent
                           moods, instances of these Care Statements will be created as the Act concept moves through the downstream stages of the business
                           cycle of Acts, e.g. Events. As mentioned above, the Fulfillment ActRelationships to the Care Plan component Acts represents
                           the downstream instances in the Act business cycle.

                        Between the use of Definition mood in the Guideline Class Components, the Intent moods in the Care Plan Class Components,
                        the Acts in Predicate moods related to the Care Plans and Components, and the Fulfillment Acts, all the options for moodCode
                        can be used in the Care Plan Structure, thus giving an overview on the dynamics of a whole set of (specialized) Acts planned
                        or performed during Care Provision. Clinician thus can track the status of their work carried out on behalf of Patients or
                        other Targets of Care.
                        <p><strong>Goals in Care Plans: </strong>Goals are common within Care Plan phases, and often must be met in order to move a patient from one phase of a Care Plan to
                           another. For example, for a patient to move from the post-operative recovery room to a surgical floor bed, certain vital signs
                           must be stable. Whether these goals are considered met or not met may depend on clinician judgment or on decision support
                           rules stored in Observation.derivationExpr. A typical goal is expressed as an Observation scheduled for some time in the future
                           with a particular value in the observation.value field. For example, a rule may state that the observation of a heart rate
                           between 60 and 100 must be present at the time of discharge from recovery. A Care Plan may identify this heart rate as a goal
                           for 30 minutes after entry to the recovery unit. 
                        </p><strong>Order Sets in Care Plans:</strong> Order sets can organize and structure complex health care plans into useful units of work for clinicians. An order within
                        an order set can request any clinical activity including referrals (requests for encounters), acts, supplies, procedures and
                        observations among others. Structured observations and goal setting can also be supported from the order set. The sharing
                        of care protocols and regimes authored as phased order sets has a much broader audience for work on error reduction, standardization
                        of care and quality improvement. Order sets in this context can be envisioned as action elements within a care plan, allowing
                        a clinician to organize and request a step in a larger protocol.   
                        <p>Definition of the structure and function of orders and order sets for an implementation-independent EHR referred to as the
                           virtual medical record (vMR) is a central issue in development of interoperable functionality necessary to publicaly published
                           guidelines that may be used by multiple institutions. HL7 Clinical Decision Support Technical Committee is in the process
                           of describing a multi-layered standard that supports the publication and maintenance of order set libraries, the sharing of
                           order sets between collaborating institutions, the structuring of order sets to support effective clinical use, and the interoperation
                           of order sets within advanced clinical guideline support software. Organizations employing this standard would deploy the
                           depth of specification appropriate to their enterprise needs and the capabilities of their clinical systems architecture and
                           performance.

                        Within a specific phase or order set, the detail of how care is intended to be delivered is expressed. This detail includes
                        the expression of goals and measurements of outcomes after interventions are applied. Order sets specifically include particular
                        sequences of orders and decision support rules, including rules for stopping or revising orders and rules for entering or
                        exiting the current order set in order to enroll the patient in a new phase of the care plan.
                        <p><strong>Clinical Decision Support Rules in Care Plans: </strong>Management of the flow between phases of a care plan is implemented via decision support rules expressed in instances of the
                           observation class.. These rules, in whatever decision support language is used, may be expressed in the Observation.derivationExpr
                           attribute in the observation class included as a component of the current phase of a Care Plan. Typically the rule evaluates
                           current observations on the patient against goals expressed for the current phase of care and determines whether the patient
                           is ready to move on to the next phase of care.

                        Committee. Examples used in Care Provision models include expressions as simple as formulae for calculations, such as summing
                        up a total score, or as complicated as making a choice between two potential actions based on decision criteria expressed
                        in the derivation expression logic syntax.

                           is to set goals in the Care Plan. It works like this: If an Observation at a point in time (that is expressed in a care statement
                           observation) has a particular value, the clinician can state a better value as goal and Plan activities in the Care Plan to
                           achieve the goal and thus to improve the situation for the patient. Alternatively, the Guideline on which the Care Plan can
                           be based can state a reference value for a particular observation and the ObservationGoal can be used to define that in the
                           Care Plan for the individual patient (Target).   
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        In the event mood of this observation (that is then the 2nd instantiation for this observation, where goal is the 1st), the
                        actual value is present and can be compared to the ObservationGoal value. The variation can also be determined, which is a
                        third instantiation of the observation, related to the goal and to the actual value.

                        <p>In the Planned Choice box, all the different Act classes are in Intent mood (INT) to indicate what activities, observations,
                           encounters, and substance administrations, etc. are planned in the Care Plan for an individual.

                        The PlannedCare choice box has an inFulfillment Act relationship with the Guideline choicebox. This can be used to determine
                        that an act in the PlannedCare choice box fulfills the suggested act in the guideline.   
                        <p>{Future work for the Care Plan will include further expression of the exact mechanics for this relationship, including the
                           explanations for it, and the changes of moods and acts status}.   
                        </p><strong>Criterion</strong><p>  The PlannedCare choice box has a act relationship named 'conditions' to the Act Criterion.  The function of Criterion is
                           explained in depth elsewhere in the D-MIM. It functions here in a similar way: to set limits and criteria to particular acts.
                           
                        </p><strong>Material </strong><p> Via the consumable participation the SubstanceAdministrationIntent Act class in the PlannedCare choice box has a direct link
                           to the Role Choicebox Material, in which the roles AdministrableMaterial and Medication can be selected and thus the Entity
                           MaterialKind and via the MaterialPart role to MaterialKind2. MaterialKind is constrained to class codes PART or INGR (ingredient)
                           It functions similarly as in the Care Statement and allows to determine in the Care Plan what substance should be given at
                           what time.  
                        </p><strong> ConditionTracking</strong><p>  Via the 'reason' relationship the PlannedCare choice box is linked to the ConditionTracking CMET.  </p><strong>Care Statement</strong><p>  The Care Statement (as CMET expressed here to link to the whole structure in the R-MIM) is linked to the PlannedCare choice
                           box via the fulfillment relationship. This functions such that the planned care acts in intent mood and the care statement
                           acts that are in event mood are linked to each other.

                        Similar to the Care Plan Act, the Goal Observation is linked to the PlannedCare choice box (as a shadow). Its function is
                        the same here as described above for Care Plan.

                        In clinical care, a care plan is reviewed regularly. This can be done on ad hoc basis, e.g. based on changes in the condition
                        of the patient, or when particular observations are present as care statement. However, it is also possible to have a predetermined
                        review of the care plan. For example in elderly care, the care plan will not change very often, but still would require an
                        annual or 6 month review.   
                        <p>The class code is REV for review, the mood is Intent and the effective time is the date of the reassessment.  </p><strong> Performer   </strong><p>The AssignedPerson that carries out the acts from the PlannedCare choice box is linked to it via the Performer participation.
                           
                        </p><strong>Annotation  </strong><p>It is possible to add annotations to the Care Plan via the subject of relationship.   Annotation in relation to PlannedCare
                           has an Act class code, the EVN moodcode, the text attribute to document the annotation and the statuscode is completed to
                           indicate that the annotation is ready.
