                        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                        <p>As discussed in <a href="../../domains/uvci/uvci.htm#intro-MCCI_DO000000UV-ic" class="">Transmission Infrastructure Introduction</a>, the "Trigger Event Control Act" contains administrative information related to the "controlled act" which is being communicated
                           as a messaging interaction.  A Trigger Event Control Act describes the 'action' that is happening to the subject of the message
                           (the payload).  The Trigger Event Control Act contains details about the trigger event for the message such as who, when,
                           where and why.
                        </p>
                        <p>In general, the Trigger Event Control Act Infrastructure is intended to promote the reuse of similar structures that are used
                           for the same type of interactions across the domains that contribute content to the HL7 Version 3 messaging standard. This
                           chapter will discuss the alternate forms of the Trigger Event Control Act and an overview of their intended use. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Trigger Event Control Act Categories</strong></p>
                        <p>The Trigger Event Control Act includes general administrative information related to a controlled act that is being communicated
                           as a messaging interaction. The Trigger Event Control Act varies in structure depending upon the type of message interaction.
                           The categories of message interaction currently recognized are: 
                           
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>Action, Information, or State Transition Control messages</li>
                           <li>Query and Query Response messages</li>
                           <li>Master File / Registry Act messages</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Accept-level acknowledgements are a message control function that do not require or allow a Control Act.</p>
                        <p>Application-level acknowledgement (functional response) message interactions require the Trigger Event Control Act and, in
                           most cases, include a domain specific application response. Certain interactions will employ the use of <a href="../../domains/uvmt/uvmt.htm#intro-COMT_DO000000UV-ic" class="">Shared Messages</a> as the functional response. Although the application acknowledgement (functional response) is normal, an application response
                           message is also allowed to exist with only the Control Act that carries no additional domain content.  If the response is
                           not defined by a domain interaction, the use of a  <a class="">Transmission Infrastructure Interaction</a> would be appropriate.
                        </p>
                        <p>What follows is a brief discussion of each of the above message interaction categories.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Action, Information, and State Transition Control Interactions</em></p>
                        <p>These include all messages which convey application content with the exception of Query and Master File / Registry (see below).
                           Messaging interactions occur between an originating application and a receiving application. For reliable messaging interactions,
                           there is a sequence of at least two messaging events. Refer to <a href="../../domains/uvci/uvci.htm#intro-MCCI_DO000000UV-ic" class="">Transmission Infrastructure </a> for the modes of messaging. The initial message interaction generally passes application content that is the purpose for
                           the messaging interaction sequence.  
                        </p>
                        <p>Depending on the receiver responsibilities of the initial message interaction, there might be a second message interaction
                           that is some level of acknowledgement response. The acknowledgement could be by the receiving application or could be a surrogate
                           for the receiving application that may only guarantee delivery of the content to the intended application.   
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon receipt of a positive application acknowledgment (response), the payload will indicate what was done (the promise, event,
                           modified object, etc.).  A negative application acknowledgement (rejection) won't contain any of those.  The message interaction
                           id and trigger event id indicate that this is a rejection.  
                        </p>
                        <p>The "semantic content" of a message is the combination of the ControlAct and the payload.  To fully understand the trigger
                           event you need both.  The Control Act just says "Please 'do something' with 'this thing'".  The payload is needed to indicate
                           what 'this thing' is.  However, the bulk of the trigger event information is attached to the Control Act:  
                        </p>
                        <p>Because this information tends to be reasonably consistent, irrespective of domain, the ControlAct has been defined as a reusable
                           message type and will be referenced in the domain interaction.  This saves committees the trouble of defining the content,
                           simplifies their message types, and ensures consistency.  However, the combination is needed to understand what is really
                           happening. 
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Query Specification/Query Response Interactions</em></p>
                        <p>
                           Query Specification and Query Response interactions have a form of the Control Act that contains elements that are needed
                           to establish and control a logical query session between two applications.  A more complete discussion of the use of the query
                           support provided in this ballot is discussed in the <a href="../../domains/uvqi/uvqi.htm#intro-QUQI_DO000003UV-ic" class="">Query Control, Query Infrastructure (QUQI) domain chapter</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Master File / Registry Act Interactions</em></p>
                        <p>
                           Master File / Registry Act messaging interactions are the third and last category of message interaction types that require
                           a unique Control Act structure in the current HL7 Version 3 Composite Message Payload Specification.  This infrastructure
                           is presented in detail in the <a href="../../domains/uvmi/uvmi.htm#intro-MFMI_DO000000UV-ic" class="">Master File / Registry Infrastructure (MFMI) domain chapter</a>.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Customization and Refinement of Trigger Event Control Acts</strong></p>
                        <p>The message types defined in the Message Control Act Infrastructure section of the ballot are highly generic and inclusive.
                           In order to permit expressivity where needed by implementers, most of the attributes and relationships are defined to be optional.
                           The use cases for the general messages are so abstract that most useful constraints are impossible to specify at this level.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, in some cases, it is desirable to indicate a performer as well as an author, for an act.   The performer is the
                           party who actually performs the act; in this case, a notification.  One can presume that there is an author for a control
                           act, however it is not required to record information about the author.  At the same time, while it is generally assumed that
                           only a single author is allowed, many performers can be specified.  
                        </p>

                        <p>This D-MIM (which is a duplicate of the R-MIM for this domain) specifies the Trigger Event Control Act structure in the HL7
                           version 3 composite message payload specification that is used for action, information, and state transition message interactions.
                           This structure specifies the superset of associations and ActRelationshipTypes that domain committees may want to specify
                           for administrative information content that is to accompany a given message interaction.  Provisions for constraining the
                           accompanying information will be made  first by committees concerning functional needs for a specific message  interaction.
                           Further constraints will be provided by the enforcement of  a conformance profile at the time of specifying the implementation
                           of  the message interaction.

                        <p>The Trigger Event Control Act plays a central role in the semantics of HL7 communication.  Information in the transmission
                           wrapper helps with message delivery.  The Trigger Event Control Act specifies precisely the nature of the event notification,
                           or the command that is given. The central construct in the trigger Event Control Act is the <strong>ControlActProcess </strong>class.
                        </p>
                        <p>The ControlActProcess class can be seen as a generalization of the HL7 Version 2 "EVN" (event) segment.  The EVN segment specifies
                           the name of the event as well as the time of the event, the person responsible for the event, etc.  These tend to be "facts
                           about the event", rather than "facts of the event". 
                        </p>
                        <p>There is inherent tension between the two different ways of representing information about the event.  Data about the event
                           can be carried by the ControlActProcess class, or by specific HL7 domain payload.
                        </p>
                        <p> Consider a new order for service.  In this case, there is a natural HL7 domain content payload (the "Order") which represents
                           the order, and who ordered it and when, etc.  For these messages, there will be a certain level of duplication between the
                           ControlActProcess associations and the domain content.  
                        </p>
                        <p>It is an HL7 design philosophy *not* to duplicate information in ControlActProcess associations that is reasonably found within
                           the carried Domain payload. Some duplication may however be unavoidable.  HL7 message senders should not need to "pluck out"
                           data from the domain content in order to populate the ControlActProcess associations.  The full richness of the ControlActProcess
                           is available as a standard design for use by messages that may need to convey this data.  Using the pre-defined associations
                           and attributes of the ControlActProcess will contribute to HL7's uniformity and consistency.
                        </p>
                        <p>The control act process class is the central construct for the transmission wrapper RMIM.  It captures information related
                           to the specific act - the trigger event - that is central to the message.  
                        </p>
                        <p>The following <strong>attributes </strong>are central to using the control act:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><em>classCode</em>:
                              
                              Mandatory, constrained to CACT, a control act. 
                           </li>
                           <li><em>moodCode</em>:
                              
                              The  x_ActMoodIntentEvent domain has been defined for this attribute to specify actual and intended events.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>id</em>:
                              
                              The identifier that has been designated for the control act or notification.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>code</em>:
                              
                              The code indicates the Trigger Event of the act or the notification that has been sent. The values are derived from the MDF,
                              examples include "COMT_<strong>TE</strong>200200" or "QURX_<strong>TE</strong>100001".  The codeSystem identifies the HL7 organization. The domain HL7TriggerEventCode has been defined to represent these
                              codes.
                           </li>

                              The text attribute can be used to convey a textual or multimedia description of the Act.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>effectiveTime</em>:
                              
                              The date and time on which the control act or notification was composed and authorized for transmission, i.e. the date and
                              time the event occurred that triggered the interaction.  This date and time will normally differ from the data and time contained
                              in the transmission wrapper.  
                              <p><strong>Example</strong>: Suspension of a prescription.    A doctor wants to suspend a prescription effective at noon the following day.  The effective
                                 time would be noon the following day   Numerous interactions might be triggered (order-entry system to pharmacy, pharmacy
                                 to nursing system).  The time associated with each of the messages associated with those interactions would be the message
                                 time.  
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li><em>priorityCode</em>:
                              A code, or a set of codes, that identifies the circumstances in which the event happened, shall happen, is planned to happen,
                              or requested to happen.  The default value is R for routine.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>reasonCode</em>: A code specifying the motivation, cause, or rationale of the Act. The reasonCode should only be used for common reasons
                              that are not related to a prior Act or any other condition expressed in Acts. Example reasons that might qualify for being
                              coded in this field might be: "routine requirement", "infectious disease reporting requirement", "on patient request", or

                              used for the identification of fine-grained reasons for the Act. The value of this attribute shall not be interpreted as a
                              refinement of the trigger event identified in the code attribute; it's value is "for information" only.

                              There are zero to many parties recorded as author or performer for a control act.  
                              <p>The author of an act is the person who takes responsibility for its creation.  This could be the doctor who orders a test
                                 or the public health professional who decides to notify a local, state, or national public health entity.

                              <p>The performer of an act is the person who actually and principally carries out the "controlled act".  The performer is rarely
                                 used.
                              </p>
                              <p>The actual party involved is either a device or a person, and the particular information involved is specified in the Assigned

                                 authoring or performing an act that is recorded as opposed to the person.  In this case, the Assigned Person CMET is still
                                 used.  However, the organization that scopes the performer role is recorded.

                           <li><em>overseer</em>: There are zero to many overseers for a control act.   In some cases but by no means all, it is relevant to record information
                              about a person who oversees the work of the acts' author or performer.  This is particularly relevant in instructional situations.
                              It is possible, but unlikely for there to be many parties acting as overseer.

                              If relevant, the party who enters data associated with the control act may be recorded.  It is possible for multiple parties
                              to provide data entry.

                              There are zero to many designated information recipients for a control act.  These are the parties who are intended to receive
                              the <em>information</em> that is included in the message.  Information recipients are differentiated from message receivers (as shown in the Transmission
                              Wrapper) because the information recipients do not have a role in the actual message management and transmission.

                              reasonable binding in the XML ITS).  This class provides an entry point into the data structure that is conveyed in the body
                              of the message.  Note that the contextConductionIndicator is always "false", i.e. none of the participations described above
                              are conducted to (inherited by) the domain payload.  Any participations that are required within the domain information model
                              need to be included there.
