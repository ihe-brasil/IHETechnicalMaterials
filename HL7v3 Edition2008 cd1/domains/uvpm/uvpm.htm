                  <p>The following harmonization proposals are pending:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Add "GRNT" participation typecode code as leaf concept under ParticipationType.  Concept code "GRNT".

                           <li>Print name: Grantor      </li>
                           <li>Definition:  A entity (person or organization) with primary responsibility for conferring privileges.</li>
                           <li>Example:  Medical practice privileges are granted to a HealthCareProvider by a hospital Board.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Rename ControlProcessId to ControlActReferenceId. The name change has not yet been incorporated into this domain's models
                        however it is referenced in the Control Act Event description in the DMIM walkthrough.

                  <p><strong>Model Changes:</strong></p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Model changes are planned to sections of the DMIM having to do with role verification.  These changes will harmonize the DMIM
                        with the new draft-for-comment cmet COCT_RM810000 that has been included in the Common Domains chapter of this publication.
                        The affected portions of the DMIM are unrelated to the material that has been released for membership ballot at this time.

                        <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
                        <p>The Personnel Management Domain spans a variety of clinical-administrative information functions associated with the organizations,
                           individuals, animals and devices involved in the delivery and support of healthcare services.    The domain content includes
                           roles, relationships, credentials, certificates, licenses, capacities, capabilities, competencies, qualifications, privileges,
                           responsibilities, and assignments issued to or managed by the involved organizations, individuals, animals and devices.  
                        </p>
                        <p>The PM Domain assumes the responsibility for communicating specific data associated with the domain content including status,
                           coded names, demographic details, participating parties, activation and termination dates, and associated supporting documentation.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                        <p>The Personnel Management Domain is organized into four Topic Areas; 
                           <b>(The user identified specification UVPM 
                              is not available)</b>, and  <b>(The user identified specification UVPM 
                              is not available)</b>.  
                           	
                           The Human Resources (HR) and Regulatory (both clinical and administrative) topics differ fundamentally in the amount of detail
                           exposed relative to a given context relationship.  As a consequence, the PM Domain's messages support a range of detail, from
                           basic existence (e.g., a provider is recognized by an organization) to highly detailed (e.g., credentialing management).
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>The Personnel Management Domain Analysis Model</strong></p>
                        <p>The following Domain Analysis Model (DAM) was developed by the personnel management committee as part of the exercise of modeling
                           the business of Personnel Management. This same business information is in turn reflected in the Domain Information Model
                           (DMIM), where needed to fulfill messaging requirements.  The purpose of the DAM is to show the relationships between the significant
                           classes in the domain and the key attributes of interest within each class. 
                        </p><em>Concept Description</em><p>Within the PM Domain, the term credential is defined as a token representing (or containing) the collection of data that attests
                           to the existence of a Relationship involving two and only two parties, the Commissioning Party and the Responsible Party.
                           As defined, a credential can be a certificate, a license, a diploma, a written verification of work experience, or other token
                           issued by the Commissioning Party as a statement of the Responsible Party's competency, capability, or capacity.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the HL7 RIM this kind of relationship is expressed as a Role wherein  the Commissioning Party is referred to as the Scoper
                           (Scoping Entity) and the Responsible Party is referred to as the Player (Playing Entity). A Role is assumed by the Player
                           (usually for a finite period of time) in the context of some sort of oversight by the Scoper.  The Role may exist independently
                           from the existence of a Credential (or Credentials); however, if Credential(s) exists they are regarded as a description or
                           attribute of the Role.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus, within this framework, the term 'credential' can be used to attest to the existence of relationships (Roles) in any
                           number of contexts and degrees of formality. This includes the processes associated with, and connotations applied to, the
                           terms license, certificate, education, work experience, capability, capacity, competency, qualification, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Example:</em>  The Jurisdictional Medical Board defines the set of competencies and time constraints associated with the role of "Licensed
                           Physician".  The Board assigns this role to a specific person thus establishing a "Licensed Physician" relationship with that
                           person and subsequently issues a license as evidence of the relationship.    Thus the Role and the Relationship defining it
                           are synonymous. The HL7 RIM represents the Medical Board as the Scoping Entity (Organization), Licensed Physician as the Role
                           and the designated person as the Playing Entity (Person). 
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Domain Analysis Walkthrough</strong></p>
                        <p>The Personnel Management Domain Analysis Model (DAM) represents the central concepts, attributes, and relationships that define
                           the domain(s)-of-interest of the Personnel Management Technical Committee (PM TC) using the iconography of UML class diagrams.
                           The development of a DAM for a given domain is described in the Requirements and Analysis chapter of the Health Development
                           Framework (HDF) process being developed by HL7.

                        <p>An initial version of the PM DAM was built over the course of two Working Group meetings in 2003 using input from a variety
                           of domain experts from Human Relations (HR), regulatory agencies, and US Department of Defense Credential and Credential/Privilege
                           Management.  It has subsequently been (and will continue to be) expanded/more finely granulated based on ongoing discussions
                           with numerous domain experts including those working on specific projects such as Provider Registries, Credentialing and Privileging
                           Systems, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>The DAM intentionally utilizes 'non-RIM-speak' (i.e. terms familiar to domain experts but not necessarily used in the RIM)
                           to capture the essential concepts, attributes, and relationships of the domain in 'domain-friendly' terms.  In the best-of-all-possible
                           worlds, the DAM would reach a fairly mature state before it would be utilized as a guide to construct a semantically equivalent
                           PM DMIM.  In fact, the PM TC had an existing DMIM before they committed to adopting the HDF and, as a consequence, building
                           a DAM.  As such, the DAM is being simultaneously developed in both a forward (DAM -&gt; DMIM) and backward (DMIM -&gt; DAM) direction.
                        </p>
                        <p>A listing of the Domain Analysis Classes is included below to provide a glossary critical to the successful understanding
                           of the mapping between the DAM and DMIM that explains the semantic equivalence between the two representations.
                        </p>
                        <p>The central conceptual idea represented in the PM DAM is that of an instance of an <strong>Entity</strong> playing/assuming a <strong>Role</strong>. Note that <strong>Entity</strong> is an abstract concept, i.e. there are no instances of the <strong>Entity</strong> concept, but instead instances of the various subtypes of <strong>Entity</strong>, i.e. <strong>Place</strong>, <strong>Organization</strong>, <strong>Device</strong>, and <strong>Living Subject</strong> (which, in turn has subtypes of <strong>Person</strong> and <strong>Animal</strong>).
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>A specific <strong>Role</strong> may require certain <strong>Qualifications</strong> (which may be bundled together in complex collections whose semantics are specified by instances of <strong>Qualification Relationship</strong>) of the <strong>Entity</strong> subtype instance playing the <strong>Role</strong>.  The specific <strong>Qualification</strong> of the 'playing' <strong>Entity</strong> instance may be validated by the 'assigning' <strong>Entity</strong> instance by one or more <strong>Credential</strong> instances issued to the playing <strong>Entity</strong>.  <em><strong>Credential</strong> is modeled as a specialization of the concept of <strong>Qualification</strong> to distinguish that a <strong>Qualification</strong> is simply an assertion, whereas a <strong>Credential</strong> involves two Parties: a Responsible Party (the receiver of the credential) and a Commissioning Party (the issuer of the credential</em>).  <em>These two concepts are currently not shown in the DAM but are conceptually represented in the PM DMIM by the relationships
                              of Player and Scoper.</em>  Note that if a specific <strong>Credential</strong> is required for a particular <strong>Role</strong>, the scoping <strong>Entity</strong> (or other person or organization) may choose to validate the existence of the credential for the specific player <strong>Entity</strong>, capturing the details of this validation process in a <strong>Certificate of Verification</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>An instance of an <strong>Entity</strong>-in-a-<strong>Role</strong> may apply for or be assigned to a <strong>Position</strong>, an action that is documented using an instance of the <strong>Application or Assignment</strong> class.  <em>Subsequent analysis as to the attributes of this class may dictate that it be split into two separate classes.</em>  A <strong>Position</strong> may be associated with one or more instances of the <strong>Responsibility</strong> class.  Similar to the relationship between <strong>Qualification</strong> and <strong>Credential</strong>, the concept <strong>Responsibility</strong> is subtyped to <strong>Privilege</strong>, a type of <strong>Responsibility</strong> with a higher degree of formality in that it involves a 'contract' between the Privilege Grantor and the Privilege Recipient
                           (concepts not currently shown in the DAM but similar DMIM concepts of Player and Scoper as discussed above).  <em>The DAM does NOT show that a <strong>Privilege</strong> may be granted to a <strong>Entity</strong>-in-a-<strong>Role</strong> in the absence of a formal assignment to a Position although this business process is often supported.  This additional association
                              is not shown because the details of any differences in messages required to support this concept are as yet unknown and uncertain</em>.  Finally, note that a <strong>Position</strong> may be associated with a complex set of <strong>Criterion</strong> instances which specify the set of <strong>Qualification</strong> and/or <strong>Credential</strong> instances and their inter-relationships in the context of a specific <strong>Position</strong>.  The <strong>Criterion</strong> class has been subtyped to <strong>Time-Based Criterion</strong> and <strong>Non-Time-Based Criterion</strong> based on domain expert input.  However, to date, little analysis has been done with respect to these concepts.

                        <p><strong>Domain Analysis Classes (Glossary)</strong></p>
                        <p>The purpose of this Glossary of the Domain Analysis Model (DAM) Classes is to define the various concepts and attributes identified
                           in the DAM and not, per se, to express the semantics of the DAM in terms of the RIM or its various derived artifacts. In particular,
                           the final semantics of such mappings, although variously indicated or implied in the Glossary definitions and/or examples,
                           may not be ultimately specified and/or unambiguously defined until the concept/attribute is included in one of the various
                           'down-stream' RIM-based artifacts (e.g. DMIM, RMIM, CMET, etc.) 
                        </p>
                        <p>NOTE:  For attributes of each of the DAM concepts (classes), the current DAM has not made any attempt to rigorously specify
                           either the type or the multiplicity of an attribute.  Such specifications obviously become critical during the construction
                           of the semantically equivalent (or nearly equivalent) DMIM and/or in the mapping of specific DAM concepts/attributes/relationships
                           to the PM DMIM
                        </p>

                           Columbia, California State Board of Medical Examiners.
                           NOTE:  if an Organization is recognized from the perspective of one or more authorities and/or other organizations external
                           to the Organization-of-Interest including legal, social, etc., the Organization is most likely an instance of the Entity subtype
                           Organization playing a role recognized by (i.e. scoped by) another Organization instance.

                              by the Person applying for the Position that the data submitted in the context of the application process (including the Person's
                              Qualifications/Credentials) are complete, accurate, etc. An Attestation is normally date/time stamped.)

                           dependent on the existence of a Role because of the common domain perspective that a 'base' or 'functional' role (e.g. Staff
                           Physician) is often necessary before the (e.g. person) in a given 'base/functional' role can be assigned to other roles (e.g.
                           Chair of Department of Cardiology, Director of ICU, etc.).

                        <p><strong>Privilege</strong>: A subtype of Responsibility that is differentiated by virtue of the fact that it is associated with specific instances of
                           Credential rather than instances of Qualification. Although a Privilege may be associated with a Position (e.g. the Position
                           of Attending Physician may be associated with Admitting Privileges), a Person in a Role may, in addition, apply for other
                           Privileges outside the context of a named Role. Each application involves at least one other Party who must review the Person-in-a-Role's
                           specific Credentials required in order for the Privilege to be granted. Requirements may be defined by the Granting Party
                           and/or by external organizations. NOTE: A Privilege differs from a Responsibility in that the association/assignment of a
                           Privilege to a Person-in-a-Role requires the interaction of at least two instances of Party, i.e. the Person-in-a-Role (who
                           may or may not be in a Position) requesting the Privilege and the Person/Organization-in-a-Role granting the Privilege. In
                           the sense that it requires a 2-Party interaction,' the concept Privilege is therefore similar to Credential.

                        <p>This walkthrough of the Personnel Management DMIM begins with a high-level overview of some of the principal features of the
                           model. Following that are descriptions of entry points and interactions that are supported by the model. The overview concludes
                           with an alphabetical listing of class objects in the DMIM and details of their use.

                        <p><strong>DMIM Overview</strong></p>
                        <p>The scope of the Personnel Management Committee's domain includes the management of information regarding People, Organizations,
                           Animals and Devices.  The "Principal Choice" choice box at the bottom center of the diagram models these entities and the
                           information directly related to them such as demographics, affiliations and language. 
                           	
                        </p>
                        <p>Of equal interest to the Committee is management of information regarding the various roles that may be played by these entities
                           and lifecycle changes of the roles themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>A central feature of the DMIM is a discrete collection of Roles that are of particular interest in the PM domain and may (with
                           some restrictions) be played by persons, organizations, animals or devices.  These roles are present in the choice box entitled
                           "Role Choice", which is also the primary entry point for RMIMs derived from this domain model.  
                        </p>
                        <p>Roles are relationships involving two parties: a player and a scoper.  As already noted the player of these 'focal' roles
                           may be different kinds of entities.  Conversely, each of these roles is scoped solely by an Organization Entity, which appears
                           just above the RoleChoice box in the diagram.
                        </p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/PRPM_NA000007.gIF" alt="PRPM_NA000007.GIF" /><br /><p>Lifecycle processes for Roles are described via the classes and associations in the upper left quadrant.  The Role Activation
                           act is used to communicate state changes (add/update/terminate) applied to the (subject) roles.  Authorship of the activation
                           acts is by the Organization entity that scopes a subject Role.  For activations, the Organization is acting in its capacity
                           as a Commissioning Party. The Commissioning Party may also i) furnish administrative 'proofs' (e.g. licenses) as primary performer
                           of CredentialSupply events and ii) grant privileges.  Commissioning party tasks may be delegated to an IssuingAgent.  
                        </p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/PRPM_NA000008.gIF" alt="PRPM_NA000008.GIF" /><br /><p>The top right quadrant of the diagram models the acts associated with verifying roles in all their particulars.  The collected
                           classes in this portion of the model are still primarily placeholders for future work.  The (minimal) structure in the current
                           model shows that Verification can be the task of an independent verification agent (e.g. a Credential Verification Organization)
                           that utilizes data from the actual role scoper or else various trusted sources as informants.   
                        </p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/PRPM_NA000009.gIF" alt="PRPM_NA000009.GIF" /><br /><p>In the upper portion of the model is the Vetting class, another placeholder class that anticipates requirements for many types
                           of observations that precede creation/activation of a role by a regulatory body (aka a Commissioning Party).
                        </p>
                        <p>Service Delivery Location and service delivery related contact information is modeled in the bottom left corner of the diagram.
                           This portion of the model is especially relevant to an entity playing either a HealthCareProvider or AssignedEntity role and
                           arises from requirements to support Registry operations.  
                        </p>
                        <p>In the lower right quadrant, and linked to the RoleChoice box, are various acts for regulatory and reference information that
                           are commonly tracked for entities playing Employee, HealthCareProvider and AssignedEntity roles.  Again, these mainly arise
                           from requirements for Registry operations.  
                        </p>
                        <p>And finally, in the upper middle portion of the diagram is a ControlActEvent with associated participations and observations.
                           This structure is part of a complex protocol for communicating audit information and is designed primarily to support registry
                           operations.   
                        </p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/PRPM_NA000006.gIF" alt="PRPM_NA000006.GIF" /><br /><p><strong>Entry Points and Interactions</strong></p>
                        <p><em>R_Assigned Entity CMET (COCT_RM090000)  </em></p>
                        <p>Entry point to the model is through the R_AssignedEntity role and links to the classes to support the complete description
                           of an Assigned person, organization or device as used by the R_AssignedEntity CMET and its derivations. The committee retrofitted
                           this CMET into the DMIM with minimum changes; however in some cases it was not possible to support the identical CMET structures
                           as it conflicted with current tooling and methodologies. It is the committee's intention to submit change requests for this
                           CMET in a later ballot. 	
                        </p>
                        <p><em>E_Organization CMET (COCT_RM150000)  </em></p>
                        <p>Entry point to the model is through the Organization Entity class and links to the classes to support the complete description
                           of an organization as used by the E_Organization CMET. The model supports the description of Organizational hierarchies ('partof'
                           and 'contains' roles) and contact information for a person acting as a liaison for the organization. The committee retrofitted
                           this CMET into the DMIM with minimum changes; however in some cases it was not possible to support the identical CMET structures
                           as it conflicted with current tooling and methodologies. It is the committee's intention to submit change requests for this
                           CMET in a later ballot.	
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Human Resource (Staffing &amp;Assignment) Interactions</em></p>
                        <p>Entry point to the model is through the RoleChoice box.  The RMIMs for staffing and assignment messages constrain the entry
                           point to one of two focal classes, either AssignedEntity or Employee.  The playing Entity for either role supports different
                           kinds of demographic information depending upon whether the subject is a person, organization or animal.   
                        </p>
                        <p>The focal role is scoped by an Organization entity that in turn plays the role of a Commissioning Party responsible for creation
                           and promulgation of the particular focal Role (e.g. an organization that defines a functional role to which a person is assigned).
                           A standard set of scoper demographics are supported; with the exception of scoper for the Citizen role and for Member role,
                           which have unique requirements.   
                        </p>
                        <p>Interactions for managing personnel records, and for some types of registry operations, often encompass a broad spectrum of
                           information about a person.  A playing entity may have a multitude of concurrent roles, in addition to the focal one of Employee
                           and/or AssignedEntity.  These concurrent roles are 'bound together' via a RoleLink class (relatedTo) that can be seen on the
                           model on the far right of the RoleChoice box. When serialized for a message the model permits multiple walks from the focal
                           role to other related roles for the same playing entity as: an AssignedEntity (functional role in an organization), QualifiedEntity
                           (education &amp; training), HealthCareProvider (licensed practitioner), OtherLicencedEntity (licensed roles other than Provider),
                           Employee (HR classification for payroll / remuneration purposes), Citizen or Member (of a resource group).   
                        </p>
                        <p>An example: an employed physician may hold multiple qualifications (QualifiedEntity roles), some relating to his licensed
                           role of HealthCareProvider and some to his Employee or AssignedEntity roles. The rolelink supports differential association
                           of these roles by binding together those that are dependent.   
                        </p>
                        <p>The current model supports only a limited set of attributes for the aforementioned Roles, their scoping entities, and the
                           subject player. However, the list of supported attributes is increasing with each ballot cycle, as more use cases are incorporated
                           into the domain model. Details about all of the classes can be found in the alphabetical listing at the end of this section.
                           However, two attributes worth particular mention are present on almost all the focal roles: Role.statuscode, for communicating
                           state changes, and Role.CertificateText to support the exchange of human readable certificates (e.g., an image of a License)
                           or fully encoded (machine processable) certificates.  (A computable form of certification data is supported elsewhere in the
                           model, in the Vetting act).      
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Verification Interactions</em></p>
                        <p>Although still in development this model is intended to support interactions for ordering and resulting of credential verification
                           activities. Roles represent a credentialed relationship between the scoper and player and the intent of these interactions
                           is to ascertain the veracity of (usually) the player's claim to the competency embodied in that role.   
                        </p>
                        <p>Entry point to the model is through the VerificationRequest and thereafter to the multiple Verification acts by which the
                           request is fulfilled. A verification request is placed in Order mood, and responded to in Promise and Event (fulfillment)
                           moods.   
                        </p>
                        <p>Three participations are supported for the Verification events: the Subject of the activity, identified as one of the focal
                           Roles within the role choice box; the PrimaryPerformer that carries out the verification activity, acting as an agent of a
                           credential verification organization; and one or more Informants that substantiate the asserted competency. Informants are
                           TrustedSource agents of either the organization that scopes the subject role or of a separate agency (e.g., a Practitioner
                           Data Bank) that supplies evidentiary data.   
                        </p>
                        <p>The model also supports the description of Documentation (the Document act) pertinent to the individual Verification acts.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Regulatory (Role Activation) Interactions</em></p>
                        <p>Although still in development this model is intended to support interactions between regulatory agencies that scope roles
                           (define and manage them) and organizations that are consumers of such information. Entry point to the model is through a focal
                           role (in the RoleChoice box) with a walk through the subject participation to the RoleActivation control act. The latter communicates
                           pertinent details about the regulatory activities, including state transitions of roles. Two participations are supported:
                           the subject role, as already noted, and the author (CommissioningParty).   
                        </p>
                        <p>The author participation supports detailed information about the scoping organization in its role as the creator/manager of
                           the Role. In both the DMIM and DAM this role is known as that of CommissioningParty. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The RoleActivation trigger event is linked to (is the outcome of) observations that precede the activation of a role. This
                           is the Vetting act, which in this model is a 'collector' of observations: it supports communications about a person's/organization's
                           capabilities, competencies, capacities and etc. Details are encapsulated in the .value attribute of the Act. Vetting activities
                           may include acquiring information from external regulatory bodies. For example, the CommissioningParty is a State Licensing
                           Board which has had the education qualifications of an applicant verified before issuing a license (a role activation) to
                           practice as a HealthCare Provider.) To support the description of these inputs the Vetting act has a 'pertains' relationship
                           to the Verification act and its associated classes.   
                        </p>
                        <p>Regulatory agencies are also sources of credentials and a CredentialSupplyEvent act is included in the model to communicate
                           the issuing of certificates. This Act captures the details of the issuance of a physical or virtual token that attests to
                           Activation of a Role. For example, a diploma (or copy thereof) attesting to the completion of university studies may be issued
                           to a qualified recipient any number of times as requested. This Act is distinct from the original Vetting act or Role Activation.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Provider Registry Interactions  </em></p>
                        <p>Entry point to the model is through the HealthCareProvider role, which is the focal class for interactions related to Provider
                           Registry messages.  Registry interactions use many portions of the model described in the earlier sections.  Readers should
                           refer to the class descriptions below as well the RMIMs in the Provider Topic.

                        <p>Entry point to the model is through the AssignedEntityRole role, which is the focal class for interactions related to Organization
                           Registry messages.  The player of this role is restricted to a PrincipalOrganization, but otherwise uses many of the same
                           model components as the Provider Registry messages.  Readers should refer to the class descriptions below as well the RMIMs
                           in the Organization Topic.

                        <p>The committee has started work on describing privileges (See Privilege and PrivilegeCategorization class descriptions) and
                           will expand the model in future releases.  Structures to support the description and verification of Responsibilities are
                           planned fora future version of the DMIM. 
                        </p><strong>Alphabetical Class Listing</strong><p>Classes from the DMIM are listed alphabetically within each type (Act, Entity, Role and Other - including Role Link). Associative
                           classes (Participation, Act Relationship) are described in the context of their source and/or target and not listed separately.

                              role scoping the organization that, in its turn, scopes the role of interest.  Identification of the actual geopolitical region
                              is done via the playing entity, Jurisdiction. The model supports nested descriptions (e.g. a state territory within a country)
                              through use of the PART rolelink, with separate playing entities (jurisdictions) for each role.

                                 that  slated for incorporation into Release 2 of the V3 standard..   They are used in conjunction with a proposed new attribute,
                                 ControlActReferenceId, that is (will be) a component of the HXIT datatype extension.  See Modeling and Methodology paper on
                                 "HL7 UpdateMode and Accountability History" for details. When the HXIT extension is enabled for a class or attribute a string
                                 value can be entered (in a message instance) for both the ControlActReferenceId and ControlActEvent.id, thereby creating a
                                 binding between the two.  Audit data relevant to the class or attribute with the HXIT extension can then be carried in the
                                 associated AssignedEntity2 and Observation classes that can be seen on the DMIM.  Note that the HXIT extension is NOT visible
                                 on the graphical model, but can be enabled by a committee for incorporation into a message schema.

                                 is a Territory-of-Authority role scoping the organization that, in its turn, scopes the role of interest.  Example: the Board
                                 having Territorial authority for the state of Maryland licenses physician to practice in that state. The Territory of Authority
                                 is played by a place (classcode =&lt;PLC&gt;, which in this model is the Jurisdiction clone.  Code for an actual geopolitical region
                                 (state, country, province etc) is carried in Jurisdiction.code and can be constrained by specialization of Jurisdiction.classcode.
