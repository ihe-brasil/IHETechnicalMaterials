                  <p>This first release of Scheduling supports the simple scenario of a scheduling application sending basic notifications to an
                     auxiliary application.  The intent is to establish a standard for the minimum functionaity that is useful and comprehensive
                     enough to explore the important concepts.  This miimum functionality is notifications of new appointments, revised appontments,
                     cancelled appointments, and rescheduled appointments.  Later releases will build upon this basic set of interactins to include
                     requests and queries.  In addition to appointments, Scheduling also includes the concepts of resource time slots. Slots will
                     also be supported in later releases.

                        <p>A Scheduling message can specify individual resources associated with an appointment.  A prerequisite for exchanging messages
                           about resources is a synchronized catalog of locations, equipment, supply items, and staff.  These resources can be identified
                           by ID, name or type.

                     <div class="body">
                        <p>Scheduling messages are genereic and can be used to schedule any type of activity.  The basic assumption behind Scheduling
                           messages is that these messages can be customized.  Therefore, the class code and Act.code for the Appointment is not constrained.
                           The assumption is that they will be specified during implementation or at run time according to the type of activity being
                           scheduled.
                        </p>

                     <div class="body">
                        <p>There are some conventions used by Scheduling that are slightly different from other domains.  Since Scheduling is active
                           before the actual service is performed, some of the prototypical state and transition names are misleading when used within
                           the Scheduing context.  Therefore, Scheduling follows the convention of using New rather than Activate to indicate that a
                           new appointment has been booked.  Also, Scheduling uses Cancel rather than Abort to indicate that an appoiintment is no longer
                           booked.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to naming conventions, revising the time of an appointment is a frequent and special case of appointment revisions.
                           For this reason, there is a separate trigger event and interaction for Reschedule Appointment in addition to Revise Appointment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another convention is the use of the participation effective times to indicate when a resource is needed before or after the
                           actual Appointment time.  In other domain messages, activity time may be used for this purpose.  The effective time in the
                           Appointment is the default and usually, the patient's time.

               <div class="body">
                  <p>There are two known issues that have been discovered since Release 1 was finalized.  The first is the timing of participations
                     in the Reschedule Appointment message.  Since each participation may have a different effective time from the effective time
                     of the Appointment, the Reschedule message must contain these participation times also.  The second issue is the lack of a
                     Supply Order ID.  These issues are easily remedied without viololating backwards compatibility and will be part of Release
                     2.

                        <p>In Version 3, Scheduling is both a domain and a process.  As a domain, Scheduling offers a generic set of messages and behavior
                           to implement any number of Scheduling scenarios. As a process, Scheduling offers an abstract data model and a set of operations
                           to any domain within HL7 that utilizes scheduling concepts.  We can consider Scheduling as a <em>service</em> and the use of that service as an <em>interface</em>.  This release of V3 contains generic scheduling messages that can be implemented by themselves or they can be used as a
                           pattern for domain-specific messages.
                        </p>
                        <p>The scheduling  messages in this section are designed to communicate various events related to the scheduling of generic appointments
                           for healthcare services.  There are three basic types of interactions defined in the scheduling domain:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                           <li>
                              <p>Request messages and their responses </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Query messages and their responses, and </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Unsolicited notifications </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Request transactions communicate requests for the scheduling of appointments for healthcare services or for the booking of
                           resource slots.  These transactions occur between placer (requesting) applications and fulfiller (scheduling) applications.
                           The query transactions allow any application to query the current schedule of booked and available slots or booked appointments.
                           Unsolicited transactions provide for the notification of scheduling information between systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>For this publication of the HL7 Scheduling standard, we are limiting the scope to four basic appointment notification interactions:
                           New Appointment, Revise Appointment, Cancel Appointment. and Reschedule Appointment  Future releases will expand the scope
                           to include additional scenarios, including requests, queries and slot management.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Scheduling as an Interface to Services</strong></p>
                        <p>To understand Scheduling as a service, consider the Unified Modeling Language (UML) concept of an interface in the graphic
                           below.  In object terminology, an <em>interface</em> is a collection of operations that are used to specify a <em>service</em> of a class or component.  In HL7 Version 3, the ActAppointment class is the focus class for all scheduling notification messages.
                           The initial operations offered by the ActAppointment class are the four interactions listed above.  The domain classes that
                           might interface to Scheduling are Encounter, Procedure, Observation, etc. as listed along the right-hand side of the graphic.
                        </p>
                        <p><br /><img class="graphic" src="graphics/PRSC_NA000003.gif" alt="Scheduling is a Service offered by the generic ActAppointment class." /><br />Scheduling is a Service offered by the generic ActAppointment class.<br /></p>
                        <p>The interface concept defines a service that is realized by an object through its operations.  These operations are the interactions
                           listed inside the <em>interface</em> object in the graphic.  
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Definitions and Relationships</strong></p>
                        <p>In this section, a generic scheduling service is defined using abstract concepts that apply equally well to any scheduling
                           activity.  While some of the following concepts are not supported in this first release, it is important to understand the
                           entire Scheduling domain first by reviewing the definitions.  In addition to the Patient, which is defined as elsewhere in
                           this standard, the following terms have a special meaning within the context of HL7 V3 Scheduling:

                              <p><strong>Schedules</strong> control the allocation of slots to certain services and the use of particular resources.  They consist of a set of open,

                           to exchange slot information frequently in order to stay synchronized, while more loosely-coupled systems can exchange appointment
                           information without needing to be constantly synchronized.  The Patient can be identified with an ID or by name and the resources
                           can be specified by ID or by type.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Application Roles</strong></p>
                        <p>Many application roles have been identified within the scheduling process.  Shown below are the definitions of these application
                           roles.  For this publication of the HL7 Scheduling standard, all application roles are not supported due to the limited scope.
                           It is important to note that a scheduling application can fulfill multiple roles.  For example, the application can be both
                           an informer of an appointment as well as a requestor for an appointment from another application.  .
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Appointment Informer</strong> - In this role, the application notifies a tracking system that an appointment has been booked or modified in some way.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Appointment Tracker</strong> - In this role the application is only a receiver of scheduling information.  In other words, the application does not generate
                                 any messages, but receives notifications.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following application roles are planned for future releases:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Slot Requester</strong> - In a tightly-coupled environment where applications share knowledge about slots, the requesting application can request
                                 booking by slots.  In this application role, a system can request a new appointment, modify an appointment, or request slot
                                 status changes.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Slot Request Responder</strong> - In this role, the owner of the schedule or an intermediary responds to a request to book an appointment by specific slots.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Slot Informer</strong> - In the role of Slot Notifier, the owner of the schedule or an intermediary sends out unsolicited notifications about changes
                                 in slot status information.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Slot Tracker</strong> - In this role, the application is receiviing unsolicited information about slots.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Appointment Requestor</strong> - In this role, the application requests a new appointment or modifications to an existing appointment from the request responder.
                                 Usually, the request responder is the owner of the schedule.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Appointment Request Responder</strong> - The schedule owner or an intermediary responds to a request from another application.  For example, another application
                                 sends an appointment request and the request responder returns with a confirmed appointment or a denial.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Appointment Inquirer</strong> - In this role, the application makes inquires to the schedule owner application.  For example, it inquires for a list of
                                 all patients booked from 8 AM till 5 PM, for hearing examinations.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Appointment Query Responder</strong> - In this role,  the schedule owner or intermediary responds to a query submitted by an Appointment Inquirer role.  An example
                                 of the inquiry responder role is the case where an application requests a list of all booked slots for Dr. Miller and the
                                 Appointment Query Responder responds with that information.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Types of Interactions</strong></p>
                        <p>There are three basic types of interactions in the Scheduling domain:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Notifications</strong> are unsolicited messages from an Informer application notifying a Tracking application of changes in the owner's schedule.
                                 In the case of notifications, the only obligation of the tracker is to acknowledge receipt of the message. 
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Requests/responses</strong> are the messages and trigger events used between requesting applications and the schedule owner.  The requesting application
                                 initiates a message requesting that the schedule owner modify its schedule with the given trigger event and information. 
                                 The schedule owner  responds to these requests to either grant or deny the request and to supply additional details about
                                 the confirmed request.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><strong>Queries/responses</strong> are the messages and trigger events used between querying applications and schedule owner applications.  Querying applications
                                 initiate the interaction by sending a query transaction.  The owner or an intermediary then responds to the query with the
                                 appropriate appointment ot slot information.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As mentioned above, this first release only supports Notifications for New, Revised, Cancelled, and Rescheduled Appointments..</p>
                        <p><strong>Relationship Between Order, Appointment and Encounter or Service</strong></p>
                        <p>An order is what begins the entire scheduling process.  An order may cause one or more requests for the booking of resources.
                           When the scheduling application receives the request(s), it creates the appointment by booking slot(s) in the schedule associated
                           with the particular resource.  Now the appointment has been booked.
                        </p>
                        <p>In an outpatient scenario, when the patient arrives for an appointment with the physician, the outpatient encounter starts
                           and the appointment is complete.  If the patient does not arrive, the appointment is marked as a no show.  When the visit
                           is complete, the encounter is completed.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the case of an inpatient visit, where multiple services are required, when the patient arrives at the hospital, the inpatient
                           encounter is started, but the encounter is not complete until all necessary services have been rendered and the patient is
                           discharged from the hospital.
                        </p>
                        <p>Procedures and observations, as well as other clinical and non-clinical activities may be controlled by a schedule.  In cases
                           where the target of the scheduling process is a clinical activity, it may be preceded by an order or it may be part of a larger
                           ordered service.  In either case, the order would precede the appointment request, which in turn, would precede the appointment.
                           When the service begins, the appointment is complete.
                        </p>

                        <div class="heading">Description</div>
                        <p>The Scheduling DMIM has a central focus on the ActAppointment class.  This class represents the activity being scheduled.
                           It has a mood of APT for Appointment and a class_code of ACT for any kind of Act.  This is a generic appointment and can be
                           used for any sub-class of Act, including Encounters, Procedures, and Observations, among others.  An appointment can also
                           be a battery where multiple services are scheduled as a group.  This is accomplished through the recursive act-relationship
                           of an ActAppointment with itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>This generic model represents the arguments of a Scheduling service.  In other words, if a specialization of Act in another
                           domain wants to realize scheduling services, this abstract model describes the data needed to perform scheduling operations.
                           Another domain may also wish to associate domain-specific information with the appointment messages.  This can be accomplished
                           by enhancing one of the Scheduling RMIMs and publishing those enhancements within the other domain.
                        </p>
                        <p>ActAppointment is a booked appointment.  It may have been previously requested by a "placer application" in an ActAppointmentRequest.
                           Additionally, the originating Order  may also be referenced from a booked appointment.  The difference between the ActOrder
                           and the ActAppointmentRequest is that the order is authored by a healthcare practitioner and carries a professional  responsibility
                           while the request is merely asking to reserve the resources.  Not all appointments are initiated by orders, as in the case
                           of a patient-initiated request.  This chain of references is for identification purposes only and does not contain detailed
                           information about the request or the order. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The subject (usually the patient) participates directly or indirectly in the appointment.  The cardinality is 1..* patients
                           to allow for group appointments and the Participation.modeCode is included to allow for appointments where the patient is
                           not physically present.  The subject Participation.time attribute allows the patient's appointment start time and duration
                           to take place within the start time and duration for the whole appointment.  Both the subject and the performer participations
                           have a modeCode attribute to indicate a physical or remote presence.
                        </p>
                        <p>The performer, location, and reusable device participations associate the resources being reserved in this appointment.  These
                           are practitioners and high-use items that are typically controlled by a schedule.  Each resource can have its own effective
                           time interval or it can default to the time interval of the appointment.  The Participation.performInd is a boolean indicating
                           that this participation is controlled by a schedule and must be reserved before use.  A participation that does not have this
                           indicator set is not actively scheduled, i.e., for information purposes only.  Consumables can also be associated with the
                           appointment.  The Supply Order allows for a quantity of consumables (i.e., manufactured material) to be specified either by
                           name, id, or optionally, the manufacturer.  
                        </p>
                        <p>The author is the person who originated the appointment and who must confirm changes or substitutions.  This participation
                           is optional and should be a duplicate of the author participation in the Control Act wrapper for a new appointment.  For all
                           other interactions, the author of the Control Act could be different from the author of the Appointment.  Of course, they
                           could also be the same.

                        <p>A Schedule is a set of slots associated with a resource and may be used here to designate which schedule(s) the appointment
                           is occupying (for example, a physician's OR session schedule and his/her office schedule.  A Schedule may also be used for
                           any time block which is further divided into slots.

                        <p>The Scheduling domain storyboards are structured according to the focus of the interaction:  Appointments or Resource Slots.
                           If the applications are tightly-coupled, they will want to synchronize schedules at the slot level, while more loosely-coupled
                           applications will stay at the appointment level.
                        </p>
                        <p>In this second release of Version 3, the Scheduling and Logistics TC is publishing Appointment Notifications and Slot Booking
                           interactions.  More interactions, including Appointment Requests without slots and Queries are planned for subsequent releases.
                        </p>
                        <p>Scheduling interactions assume there is one owner or manager of a schedule that knows the current status of an appointment
                           or the availablity of a resource slot.  Depending on the focus of the message, this is either the <strong>Appointment Manager</strong> or the <strong>Slot Manager</strong>.  The Manager has sub-roles depending on the type of interaction.  For Notifications, the sub-role is <strong>Informer</strong>.  For Requests and Queries, the sub-roles are <strong>Request Responder</strong> and <strong>Query Responder</strong> respectively.

                              <p>The scheduling process is not limited to any specific domain in healthcare, but applies to any situation where reservations
                                 for scarce resources have to be made in advance. All kinds of healthcare activities can be scheduled such as in- and outpatient
                                 encounters, procedures, observations, food and transportation services.
                              </p>
                              <p>The storyboards in this domain illustrate several different scenarios for scheduling. The scenarios illustrated under the
                                 Appointment topic are typical loosely-coupled applications communicating for mutual benefit, but with a minimum of required
                                 responsibility.  In these scenarios, various systems may be interested in maintaining the status of a certain category of
                                 patient appointments. The appointment data may be used as auxiliary information within their database, or serve as input for
                                 their software process (external triggers).
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p>The scenario under the Slot topic is for a tightly-coupled cinfiguration where systems must maintain scheduling information
                                 in near-real time.  Schedules of slots are maintained in separate systems and synchronized through frequent communication.
                                 Slots are requested for booking and the response must be timely.
